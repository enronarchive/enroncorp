<ul><li> Type information into each block that you want to appear on your resume. <br>
We recommend that you enter the following information as a <em><strong>minimum</strong></em>:
<ul><li> Name
<li> One Address
<li> One Phone Number
<li> One entry for Education
<li> One entry for Employment History
</ul>
<li> Hit the tab key to advance to the next <strong>single line</strong> entry block. Sorry, but you'll need to click your mouse to enter and exit <strong>multi-line</strong> text blocks.
<li> We suggest that you enter a <code> RETURN</code> at the end of each line in a multi-line text block. You can keep typing if you want, but you'll find it easier to read and edit your form if you can scroll down instead of left and right.
<!--
<LI> After you finish entering your resume information, scroll to the bottom and click the "Format" button to see your resume.
<LI> To get a printed copy of your resume to mail, select the "Print" option of your web browser and print it locally.
<LI> To save an ASCII copy of your resume to send via e-mail, select the "Save" option of your web browser and then the "Text" option in the Save dialog box. This will save the text to your local system. You can then e-mail it, or copy and paste it into application forms on the web.
<LI> To save a formatted copy of your resume to edit later, select the "Save" option of your web browser and then the "Source" option in the Save dialog box. This will save the HTML source file to your local system. You can edit this file with any text editor, then display and print it with your web browser - use the "Open File" option to access it on your local disk.
