<h3>Tips for writing and formatting a scannable resume that computers
can read</h3>

The On-Line Resume Builder incorporates many of the tips mentioned
below, and can be a useful tool in preparing an informative,
scannable resume.

<p>
There's a new technology that could be very helpful to you. It could help
you find your next job. It's called electronic applicant tracking, and it's
being used by leading businesses and organizations.
<p>
By using the latest in document imaging technology, your resume can be
scanned into a computer system and kept "active" for years. The computer
can search for just about anything in your resume. You could be qualified
and considered for jobs you never thought of. The computer can make it
easier for you to be considered for more jobs, and it keeps your one
resume on file so it's quicker to update your information.
<p>
Here's how it works. Your resume is scanned into the computer as an image.
Then OCR (optical character recognition) software looks at the image
to distinguish every letter and number (character) and creates a
text file (ASCII). Then artificial intelligence "reads" the text and
extracts important information about you such as your name, address,
phone number, work history, years of experience, education, and skills.
<p>
Why is it important for you to know this? When you prepare a resume
for the computer to read, you want it to be "scannable". A scannable
resume is clean so that the scanner can get a clean image. A scannable
resume has standard fonts and crisp, dark type such as a laser printer
or a typewriter with a new ribbon would produce - so the OCR can recognize
every letter. And a scannable resume has plenty of facts for the artificial
intelligence to extract - the more skills and facts your provide, the
more opportunities you'll have for your skills to match available
positions.

<h2>A Scannable Resume:</h2>
<h3>
<ul>
<li>Maximizes the computers' ability to "read" your resume
<li>Maximizes your ability to get "hits" (a hit is when one of your skills
    matches the computer search)
</ul></h3>
<hr>
Preparing a scannable resume is easy; like the traditional style resume, you
focus on format and content.

<h2>Format</h2>

To maximize the computer's ability to read your resume, provide the 
cleanest original and use a standard style resume.
<p>
The computer can extract skills from many styles of resumes such as
chronological (list and describe up to 6 jobs in order by date), achievement
(describe achievements rather than job titles), functional (organize by
skills rather than job titles), and combinations of resume types.
<p>
The most difficult resume for the computer to read is a poor quality copy
that has an unusual format such as a newsletter layout, adjusted spacing,
large font sizes, graphics or lines, type that is too light, or paper
that is too dark.
<p>
<h3>Tips for Maximizing Scannability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use white or light-colored 8 1/2 x 11 paper, printed on one side only.<p>
<li>Provide a laser printed original if possible.  A typewritten original
    or a high quality photocopy is OK. Avoid dot matrix printouts and low
    quality copies.<p>
<li>Do not fold or staple.<p>
<li>Use standard typefaces such as Helvetica, Futura, Optima, Universe, Times,
    Palatino, New Century Schoolbook, and Courier.<p>
<li>Use a font size of 10 to 14 points. (Avoid Time 10 point).<p>
<li>Don't condense spacing between letters.<p>
<li>Use boldface and/or all capital letters for section headings as long
    as the letters don't touch each other.<p>
<li>Avoid fancy treatments such as italics, underline, shadows, and reverse
    (white letters on black background).<p>
<li>Avoid vertical and horizontal lines, graphics, and boxes.
<li>Avoid two-column format or resumes that looks like newspapers or 
    newsletters.<p>
<li>Place your name at the top of the page on its own line. (You name
    can also be the first text on pages two and three).<p>
<li>Use standard address format below your name.<p>
<li>List each phone number on it's own line.
</ul>

<h2>Content</h2>

The computer extracts information from your resume. You can use your current
resume; however, once you understand what the computer searches for, you
may decide to add a few key words to increase your opportunities for
matching requirements or getting "hits".
<p>
Recruiters and managers access the resume database in many ways, search for
your resume specifically or searching for applicants with specific
experience. When search for specific experience, they'll search for key words,
usually nouns such as: <code>writer, BA, marketing collateral, Society of
Technical Communication, Spanish (language fluency), San Diego</code>, etc.
So make sure you describe your experience with concrete words rather than
vague descriptions. The computer system will extract the words and information from your sentences; you can write your resume as usual.

<h3>Tips for Maximizing "Hits"</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use enough key words to define your skills, experience, education,
    professional affiliations, etc.
<li>Describe your experience with concrete words rather than vague
    descriptions. For example, it's better to use "managed a team of
    software engineers" rather than "responsible for managing, training..."
<li>Be concise and truthful.
<li>Use more than one page if necessary. The computer can easily handle
    multiple-page resumes, and it uses all of the information it
    extracts from your resume to determine if your skills match
    available positions. It allows you to provide more information than
    you would for a human reader.
<li>Use jargon and acronyms specific to your industry (spell out the
    acronyms for human readers).
<li>Increase your list of key words by including specifics, for example,
    list the names of software you use such as <em>Microsoft Word </em>
    and <em>Lotus 1-2-3</em>.
<li>Use common heading such as: <em>Objective, Experience, Employment,
    Work History, Positions Held, Appointments, Skills, Summary, Summary of
    Qualifications, Accomplishments, Strengths, Education, Affiliations,
    Professional Affiliations, Publications, Papers, Licenses, Certifications,
    Examinations, Honors, Personal, Additional, Miscellaneous, References, </em>
    etc.
<li>If you have extra space, describe your interpersonal traits and attitude.
    Key words could include <em>skill in time management, dependable,
    high energy, leadership, sense of responsibility, good memory.</em>
</ul>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some people may want to have two versions of their resume:
<dl>
<p>
<dt><strong>One for the computer to read - </strong> with a scannable
    format and detailed information. Send this one.<p>
<dt><strong>One for people to read - </strong> possibly with a creative
    layout, enhanced typography, and summarized information. Carry this
    one to the interview.<p>
</dl>
<li>When faxing, set the fax to "fine mode"; the recipient will get a 
    better quality copy.
</ul>
