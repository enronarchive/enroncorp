<b>ePowered Solutions Provider program </b>

<p>

At Enron Broadband Services, we are committed to establishing the premier channel community in the streaming application industry.  We believe that building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with innovative technology leaders will result in your success and ultimately ours.

<p>

As an ePowered Solutions Provider, you will be offering the most ubiquitous and robust network solution available today.  Enron Broadband Services' suite of rich media ePowered applications enhances the way people communicate and conduct business on the web.  By integrating your technology solutions with ours, you are providing a clear roadmap for propelling your customers and business partners to the next level of Internet services.

<p>

The ePowered Solutions Provider program is designed to serve as conduit for increasing the growth potential of our respective businesses while unveiling more prosperous revenue opportunities for streaming applications.  We take our partnerships seriously and offer a unique business model that allows you to:
	
	<ul>Differentiate your product offerings
	Deliver incremental revenue to your bottom-line
	Drive demand for higher-speed services
	Provide your customers with next generation Internet applications</ul>

<p>

As an initial element of the ePowered Solutions Provider program, we will provide a marketing kit in conjunction with an on-site training session by your channel account coordinator.  Complete with product literature, presentations, and marketing materials, it should serve as an effective sales tool when positioning Enron Broadband Services, as well as how they integrate into your own business offerings.  In addition, we think of our channel partners as a community of technology leaders and we have designed ePowerOnline, our Extranet to foster as much learning as it does selling.
<p>
 
<a href="/project/not/">I want more information about the ePowered Solutions Provider program!</a>

<p><br>
<b>Program Overview</b>

<p>
Members realize a clear competitive advantage to integrating an advanced network solution into their own product or service offering, the combination of which results in a more powerful value proposition than the two services can achieve separately.
Upon mutual agreement, the following is a list of potential Joint Marketing &amp; Sales activities in which you may participate as an ePowered Solutions Provider Program. 

<p>
Marketing Tools
<ul>
<u>Product Information</u><br>
EBS provides its channel partners with effective product information brochures to be used as sales tools when working with customers.  Use our most current examples or integrate your own messaging for dynamic, co-branded customer literature.
<p>
<u>Training &amp; Demonstrations</u><br>
Anytime you drastically change the current paradigm, effective product demonstrations and training become paramount.  ePowered Media Cast demonstrations provide a tangible way for your customers to see the benefits of a revolutionary streaming experience.  Enron Broadband Services makes these available to you or your customers via web or CD-ROM based media.
<p>
<u>Article Reprints</u><br>
Feature articles in major publications covering the business, technology, financial and media industries represent great opportunities for you to convey value to your customers.  As Enron Broadband Services continues to garner high profile media coverage, we look to make reprints available to you whenever possible.
<p>
<u>Extranet (Content Showcase)</u><br>
As a way to demonstrate the benefits of streaming over our network, we feature content from customers on the Showcase Site of our Extranet.  As an Enron Solution Provider, we encourage you to provide us your own content to showcase, or use the site to exhibit capabilities to your customers.
</ul>


Joint Marketing 
<ul>
<u>Public Relations/Advertising</u><br>
Enron Broadband Services offers joint public relations and advertising opportunities to our ePowered Solution Providers as a way to communicate the value of our mutual offerings.  We look forward to moving each of our brands forward through the optimum mix of marketing initiatives.  Upon entrance to the ePowered Solution Provider Program, our channel representatives will help you develop the appropriate outbound marketing plan for the coming year.
<p>

<u>Seminars/Events</u></br>
Enron Broadband Services uses seminars and events as a core element of its marketing strategy.  In 2000, EBS will embark on a road show of City PoP launches, as well as other informative and educational events.  We believe the involvement of ePowered Solution Providers is critical to the success of this strategy, and look to involve channel partners wherever it makes sense.  In addition, we continually look to support creative events brought to us by our channel partners.  If you have a great idea for a seminar or event, we want to help make it happen.

<p><u>Case Studies/White Papers</u><br>
As far as rich media streaming has come today, the industry is still relatively in its infancy.  Thus, the importance of documenting and publicizing our success stories cannot be overestimated.  Enron Broadband Services is constantly scanning the horizon for opportunities to collaborate with our ePowered Solution Providers on such projects.
</ul>

Sales Programs
<ul>
<u>Defined Sales Plan</u><br>
The best way for a channel relationship to be mutually beneficial is through an agreed upon sales plan that both partners understand and agree to work towards.  After an initial period that lets you become comfortable offering ePowered Services, we will work with you to set clear objectives that will guarantee your success, and ours.
<p>
<u>Joint Calls</u><br>
Where strategic accounts deem it necessary, our sales force and engineering team is prepared to jointly present, with your personnel, the many benefits that ePowered Services can bring to your customers.
<p>
<u>Incentive Programs</u><br>
Incentive Programs can serve as a great way to extend products and services into hard to reach accounts.  Enron Broadband Services is continually evaluating how we can package our ePowered Services with tailored discount, rebate, or other incentive programs to help ensure the ultimate success of our ePowered Solution Providers.
</ul>
