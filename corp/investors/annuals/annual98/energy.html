<!-- #title Enron Energy Services -->

Enron Energy Services is the leading provider of energy outsourcing products for the commercial and industrial customer markets. Enron is focused on bringing substantial savings to customers by achieving energy cost reductions and realizing economies of scale in service and equipment purchases. During 1998, Enron significantly exceeded its contracting objectives and signed contracts representing $3.8 billion of customers' future energy expenditures. Based on both the current backlog of prospects and contracting activity, Enron expects to double the level of new contracts to be added in 1999. In addition, results for this business, which reflected losses related to start-up investments in 1998, are expected to reflect positive earnings in late 1999.

While the pace of electric deregulation continues to progress in North America, deregulation is not a major factor in Enron's ability to pursue opportunities in the commercial and industrial sectors. The "private utility" is already totally deregulated at Enron's customers' facilities. The assets in these "utilities" -- the boilers, chillers, lighting and controls -- are valued at approxi-mately $450 billion, and the services -- commodity, heating/ventilation/air conditioning and facilities management -- represent an annual market of more than $240 billion, which represents twice the value of the electricity consumed annually by these customers. 
<p>
<!-- #toplink Outsourcing opportunities -->
<a name="link1">
<h4>Outsourcing opportunities</h4>
<p>
As more and more companies evaluate their energy procurement practices, many are recognizing the inefficiencies of their decentralized systems. Rather than invest in these non-core activities, companies are choosing to outsource their energy services and reduce their cost structure. These customers recognize the benefits of transferring the risks of their energy prices, plant operations and equipment needs to Enron in exchange for a fixed price contract of up to 10 years. 
<p>
Enron provides value for customers in five areas: lower commodity and tariff prices, more efficient plant and equipment management, improved facility service, lower-cost capital and integrated energy portfolio management. Delivering full-scale energy outsourcing services requires a broad skill set that few companies possess on a national scale, including logistical systems for gas and electricity commodities, energy services capabilities, capital procurement and deployment and risk management capabilities. Enron possesses all of these skills, and its core competency of pricing and managing risk is especially critical to the execution of its national strategy. 
<p>
Prior to entering the "private utility" market, Enron anticipated the need for an energy services capability company and acquired a top engineering and design company in California and a national heating, ventilating and air conditioning service contractor that possesses installation, services and facilities management capabilities. Enron continues to develop these businesses and also integrate other service capabilities into its national platform through outsourcing contracts with customers. Enron has energy services capabilities in 24 of the 25 largest cities in the U.S. 
<p>

<a name="link2">
<h4>Meeting customers' diverse needs</h4>
<p>
Enron's customer contracts illustrate its ability to provide diverse capabilities on a national scope. When Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., North America's leading producer of canned and bottled juices and juice drinks, wanted to base its energy prices on unit production, the same measurement used to measure its core business performance, Enron fixed Ocean Spray's energy costs so that as production increases or decreases, energy costs respond accordingly. Under the 10-year contract with Enron, Ocean Spray will lower its energy costs and have greater flexibility to focus on core business activities. As Ocean Spray expands its operations, Enron has the exclusive rights to provide additional energy services.
