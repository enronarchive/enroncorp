<!-- #title Retail Energy Services -->

Enron's retail business surpassed our goals in 1999 when we signed contracts representing $8.5 billion of customers' future energy expenditures. The unit turned profitable in the fourth quarter, marking the end of our start-up phase. With systems and people in place, we are set for exponential growth and sharply increased profitability. In 2000 we expect to again double our total contract volume to more than $16 billion.

Enron has taken the lead in a rapidly expanding $243 billion U.S. retail energy market. With our experience, international presence and breadth of service, Enron alone has the scale and capability necessary to provide major customers with the quality of service they expect. In addition to Houston headquarters staff, Enron maintains eight U.S. district offices with 250 professionals and manages services at 16,500 sites with 4,500 contracted employees. This structure helps make Enron the only energy outsourcing provider with nationwide reach.
<p>
In 1999 the retail group signed contracts with scores of customers, including 10-year contracts with Owens Corning, Polaroid, Simon Property Group and the U.S. Department of Defense. Furthermore, existing contracts provide significant upsell opportunity, as the majority of Enron's large retail customers recognize opportunities and request services beyond the scope of their initial contracts.
<p>

The proposition at the heart of Enron's retail energy business is a simple one: energy management is not a core business strength for most companies. Few companies have the expertise to approach energy strategically, and often energy infrastructure and equipment are not adequately maintained and updated. In addition, companies that use large amounts of energy can realize substantial benefit when they are able to optimize electricity and natural gas purchases, benefiting from lower prices and gaining protection from unpredictable price spikes. 
<p>
When energy management is outsourced to Enron, we look at the entire energy supply chain, identifying which equipment must be updated or replaced, financing the cost of more efficient equipment and using our extensive experience in energy markets to manage the cost of the commodity. As a result, companies can reduce energy expenditures and gain significant competitive advantage in the marketplace.
<p>
Enron draws on existing businesses, resources and experience to structure comprehensive customer solutions and capture value throughout the retail transaction:
<ul>
<li>We manage the commodity supply or supply it ourselves and manage the commodity price risk.
<p>
<li>We can provide labor outsourcing for energy and facilities management.
<p>
<li>We offer both our own capital and our financing capabilities to structure and syndicate financial transactions.
</ul>

Enron's success in retail energy is not dependent on retail energy deregulation. At the close of 1999 only 23 states were in the process of opening electricity and natural gas markets to competition. Enron focuses on non-regulatory opportunities, such as improving operations and energy infrastructure, negotiating utility rates, gathering and analyzing energy usage information and managing complete facilities such as manufacturing plants and retail outlets. And energy consumption is not our sole focus: Enron's analysis of a retail customer's energy use includes examination of less obvious factors in the customer's energy cost, such as operating processes and the use of labor resources.
<p>
<!-- #toplink Customer Focus -->
<a name="link1">
<b>Customer Focus</b>
<p>
Enron's retail initiative relies heavily on the ability of our sales teams to bring in customers, both large and small, who never realized the potential benefit of energy outsourcing. In 1999 Sales &amp; Marketing Management magazine named Enron the No. 1 sales team in the United States, citing our ability to develop customized solutions and target Fortune 500 companies. Enron has also developed the capability to deliver energy services that take the best from Enron's experience in the wholesale energy business and combine it with responsive customer service. The result is a remarkable ability to create value through outsourcing contracts.
<p>
Enron is augmenting the retail market with new products and services. We compiled the first indexes for retail electricity, the Enron Energy Indexes, published weekly in <i>Megawatt Daily</i>. These indexes, used as benchmarks for the pricing of retail power, foster end-user energy price transparency and are fast becoming the de facto standard for retail pricing. 
<p>
We are commited to deliver continuously superior service to customers over the long term. To ensure that we are serving our customers well, we have established an interactive web-based system to measure customer satisfaction. The system is founded on key performance measures set by the customer and Enron. This information system helps us determine if other sales opportunities exist with the customer, and whether 
both the customer and Enron are deriving value from the relationship.
<p>
The engineering and technical expertise required by Enron's retail energy business is applicable across all customer segments, including food processors, retailers, real estate investment trusts, manufacturers and sports facilities.

Enron extended its retail network to Europe in late 1999. By building on Enron's European wholesale network, our retail operation is expected to achieve first-year positive earnings. Our retail competitiveness on the Continent is enhanced by our reputation in pan-European wholesale operations and by our knowledge of working in individual countries. As in the United States, it is not necessary to wait for full energy liberalization before moving into the European retail energy market.
<p>
Enron alone has the critical mass to roll out a pan-European network. And for our North American customers with European facilities, we are the vendor of choice for their operations abroad. 
<p>
Enron's wholesale operations also are laying the groundwork for the retail energy business in other regions. Mature energy markets, such as Japan and South Korea, where Enron has opened wholesale energy operations, have great potential for retail business as these countries continue the trend toward liberalization.
