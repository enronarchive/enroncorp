Letter to U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein					</h2>

February 26, 2001
<br>&nbsp;<br>

The Honorable Dianne Feinstein<br>
U.S. Senate<br>
331 Senate Hart Office<br>
Washington, DC  20510<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
	
Dear Senator Feinstein:
<br>&nbsp;<br>

Thank you for providing Enron the opportunity to testify before the Senate Energy and 
Commerce Committee on January 31st.  I will here elaborate on a couple of solutions I 
mentioned in my testimony and provide an update on the California crisis.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

We are running out of time in California.  This summer we are expecting a capacity 
shortage of 10% during on-peak hours.  With normal weather and currently forecasted 
hydro conditions, California will face persistent, random blackouts.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

California is not solving its problem.  While there have been some welcome efforts to 
encourage conservation and expedite the movement of applications through the byzantine 
power plant approval process, most of the activity has now shifted to an effort to 
"nationalize" California's electricity industry.  Legislation to put the state in the power 
generation business and establish state ownership of California's portion of the interstate 
transmission system is rapidly moving through the state legislature.  
<br>&nbsp;<br>

This legislation will only make matters worse. While giving the appearance of decisive 
action, a government takeover of the state's electricity system can only delay an honest 
reckoning with the very real problems that lay at the heart of the crisis. State ownership 
will not increase supply or reduce demand by a single megawatt. (Further, if previous 
experience with state-owned enterprises is any guide, it will likely reduce efficiency and 
reliability.)  Worse, the measures in front of the California legislature will actually hinder 
or thwart entirely the ability to craft workable solutions to the supply-demand problem 
that undergirds the current difficulties. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>

At the most fundamental level, these efforts distract resources from actions that could 
actually help resolve the crisis. Beyond that, they present several significant problems. 
First, the reliability of supplies throughout the West depends on an open grid to move 
power from where it is to where it is needed.  California's protectionist measures will 
only invite countermoves by other states, many of whom California needs to provide it 
with adequate supplies.  Second, unless the state overpays substantially for the utilities' 
transmission assets, these steps will leave the utilities no better off than they are 
currently. Whether the utilities hold the assets themselves or their value in cash makes no 
difference at all to their overall financial position or to the willingness of creditors to 
continue dealing with them. Third, by funding the purchase of the assets with public 
monies the state proposes to divert its hard-won surplus away from schools, hospitals, 
law enforcement or other appropriate public uses, and toward a business it doesn't belong 
in. By proposing to buy the grid with money taken from its citizens in the form of taxes 
rather than higher electric rates, the state continues to mask the true cost of power to 
California's consumers while simultaneously driving out the private enterprises that 
could bring those costs down. The only discernible merit of these destructive proposals is 
their perceived political appeal to a constituency that views rate increases as anathema.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

Let's put these legislative proposals in the context of hard realities in the state.  California 
entities are not paying their bills for power purchased. Because their rates are frozen, 
California customers don't know the cost of the power they are using--so they don't 
conserve when prices increase. Meanwhile, they unwittingly pay the true cost through the 
depletion of the state budget surplus. Instead of reducing prices by lowering demand, the 
state calls for reregulation and price caps (while neighboring states must raise their own 
rates and make up California's supply shortfall). Legislation to give the state 
condemnation authority over private businesses and facilities is moving through the 
legislature. In short, California is building an "electric fence" around its borders, and 
telling private capital – which is desperately needed – to go elsewhere.  
<br>&nbsp;<br>

I suggest the following:

		Instead, federal policy makers should focus on fully opening the power grid 
		across the country to ensure the movement of power from where it is to where it is 
		needed.  California is not the first, and will not be the last, to attempt to interfere 
		with interstate commerce in the power sector.  Our nation's grid is more reliable 
		and more efficient if it is open.  As supplies tighten around the country, the 
		problems we are seeing in California will be repeated.

		California must reform its environmental permitting process.  The irony is that the 
		current system actually reduces air quality by keeping new, more efficient plants 
		off the grid while decades-old facilities that emit NOx at levels 40 times higher, 
		continue to run.

		California must institute a program of demand "buy downs."  There is not enough 
		time to build new generation for this summer.  But, the state could take bids for 
		voluntary demand reductions.  This will reduce prices more effectively than price 
		caps and will reduce or avoid involuntary blackouts. California is tapping into an 
		enormous amount of money from the General Fund to finance DWR's power 
		purchases.  California could likely reduce demand more economically by running 
		an auction to determine the payments businesses would be willing to receive to 
		reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g., through the summer months).  
		DWR could easily run an on-line auction to determine the price it could pay for 
		these demand reductions.  To participate, businesses would be required to have 
		the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually 
		achieving the reductions. To be successful, customers need access to the 
		following key elements:

Just as important as getting these things done, is avoiding those measures that will 
make matters worse.  In addition to the ill advised state takeover of the industry 
discussed above, price caps will compound problems in the West.  "Soft" or cost-
based caps have not worked in California--they left many sellers unwilling to sell, 
they reduced competition from marketers whose cost structure simply does not 
conform to traditional cost of service ratemaking, and they left California power 
purchasers scrambling at the last minute to buy power to avoid further blackouts.  
They only add to the uncertainty sellers face in deciding whether or not to invest or 
make sales.  Cost of service ratemaking is at best a poor substitute for market pricing 
(which is why it is avoided for all services except monopoly services such as 
transmission and distribution).  Rate proceedings are contentious, often political and 
extremely lengthy proceedings.  They are particularly ill suited to situations like those 
we find in the West today (i.e. extremely volatile cost components such as fuel and 
emissions costs).  At a time when investors need assurances that the power business 
will not be "reregulated", price caps will only exacerbate the already short power 
supply situation.  There is a way to get prices down: increase supply or reduce 
demand.  The solutions outlined above do exactly that.  State takeovers and regulated 
rates do not.  Instead, they leave policymakers with the worst possible task:  deciding 
whose power to turn off.  West-wide price caps will make this even worse:  how will 
western states decide, for example, whether Idaho agriculture or California's high 
tech industry is more deserving of power during any given hour?
<br>&nbsp;<br>

Overall, California policy makers must adopt a laser-focus on measures that increase 
supply or decrease demand.  Any measure that does not accomplish one or both of 
these objectives is a waste of time at best.  At the same time, federal policy makers 
should focus on opening the interstate grid so that power can move from where it is to 
where it is needed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

Again, I thank you for the opportunity to share Enron's observations with you and 
look forward to continuing to identify real solutions to this crisis.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

Sincerely,<br>
Steven J. Kean
