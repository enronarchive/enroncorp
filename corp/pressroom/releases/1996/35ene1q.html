<h4>ENRON CORP. REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 1996 NET INCOME OF  $212.8 MILLION, OR $.86 PER
 SHARE</h4>


<!-- THIS IS WHERE THE BODY OF THE PRESS RELEASE GOES-->
<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Thursday, April 11, 1996
<P>

 HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. today reported net income of $212.8
 million for the first quarter of 1996, or $.86 per share after
 preferred dividends compared to 1995 first quarter net income
 of $195.0 million, or $.79 per share after preferred dividends.
 <P>
  Revenues were $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 1996, compared
 to $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 1995.
 <P>
  &quot;While each of our business units performed well in the
 first quarter and helped to position Enron for our targeted 10
 to 15 percent growth in earnings per share in 1996, Enron Capital
 &amp; Trade Resources (ECT) achieved tremendous results with earnings
 that nearly doubled to $97.7 million compared to $51.4 million
 a year ago,&quot; said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive
 officer of Enron Corp. &quot;The volumes ECT marketed increased
 substantially during the first quarter of 1996, and many transactions
 involved high value services that are uniquely provided by the
 company.  ECT's physical infrastructure and assets such as Louisiana
 Resources Company, Houston Pipe Line Company and Bammel storage
 allow us to take advantage of any prevailing market conditions
 and provide our customers price predictability and reliable delivery,
 which are particularly important when market conditions are stressed.&quot;
 <P>
  ECT marketed 44.2 billion British thermal units of energy equivalent
 per day (BBtue/d) of physical and notional quantities in the first
 quarter of 1996, compared to 40.9 BBtue/d during the same period
 in 1995.  ECT's U.S. power marketing business reflected even more
 significant growth in the first quarter of 1996, with a total
 of 9.9 million megawatt-hours sold, compared to 718 thousand megawatt-hours
 sold in the first quarter of 1995 and more than three times the
 3.1 million megawatt-hours sold in the fourth quarter of 1995.
 <P>
  &quot;In addition to building on the success of its U.S. power
 business, ECT is making significant progress in Europe,&quot;
 Lay said.  &quot;In the U.K. it has already closed a number of
 transactions, ranging in term from three months to ten years,
 with regional electricity companies, power generators and a major
 industrial.  Since the inception of its power marketing activities
 in January 1996, Enron has completed contracts with notional volumes
 in excess of 6.5 million megawatt-hours settled against the U.K.
 electricity pool.  We believe these are the first of a growing
 number of structured transactions in Europe,&quot; Lay said.
 <P>
  Enron Operations reported earnings before interest and taxes
 of $232.7 million in the first quarter of 1996, compared to $180.9
 million a year ago.  Enron Operations' earnings include the commercial
 and operational aspects of Enron's U.S. interstate natural gas,
 natural gas liquids and crude oil pipelines as well as fees associated
 with engineering and construction services provided to third parties
 worldwide. The 1996 and 1995 results include pretax gains of $90.2
 million and $29.2 million, respectively ($58.6 million and $19.0
 million after tax) from the sale of non-strategic gas gathering
 and processing related assets. 
 <P>
  &quot;During the first quarter of 1996, Enron's natural gas pipelines
 provided reliable service to customers across the nation, despite
 some of the coldest temperatures in recent history,&quot; Lay
 said.  &quot;In addition, Northern Natural Gas filed a settlement
 with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which if
 approved would extend contracts with its market area customers
 by two years. &quot;
 <P>
  Enron International reported earnings before interest and taxes
 of $40.3 million in the first quarter of 1996 compared to $51.2
 million a year ago.  Enron International includes earnings from
 the development and promotion of integrated energy projects, commercial
 power generation activities outside of North America and Enron
 Global Power &amp; Pipelines L.L.C. (EPP). 
 <P>
  &quot;The first quarter of 1996 was an active period for our
 international businesses,&quot; Lay said.  &quot;We began commercial
 operation of the Hainan Island and Dominican Republic power projects
 and the Colombia natural gas pipeline and signed a power purchase
 agreement (PPA) for a 754-megawatt power project in Pakistan.
  We have reached agreement with the state of Maharashtra on all
 documents relating to our India power project and, upon receiving
 approvals from the central government and project lenders, expect
 to restart construction before the end of the second quarter.&quot;
 <P>
  International results in the first quarter of 1995 included revenues
 of $23.5 million from the promotion of a portion of Enron's interest
 in its power assets at Teesside and $12.0 million recognized as
 a result of the satisfaction of Enron's support obligations related
 to the formation of EPP.  
 <P>
  Exploration and Production (E&amp;P) earnings before interest,
 minority interest and taxes in the first quarter of 1996 were
 $29.7 million compared to $58.3 million a year ago.  
 <P>
  &quot;E&amp;P's first quarter results reflect a strategic change
 implemented at year-end 1995 that we believe will prove extremely
 beneficial in subsequent quarters this year,&quot; Lay said. &quot;To
 benefit from increasing natural gas prices due to industry conditions
 that reflect a more balanced supply/demand environment, Enron
 Oil &amp; Gas Company (EOG) and Enron Corp. closed out their NYMEX-related
 hedges on EOG's 1996 natural gas production during December and
 the first quarter of 1996.  EOG recognized a loss on the hedges
 of $21.0 million ($8.3 million after taxes and minority interest)
 in the first quarter of 1996 compared to a gain of $26.3 million
 ($13.7 million after taxes and minority interest) in the first
 quarter of 1995 from NYMEX-related activities, including trading
 transactions.  Similarly, Enron Corp. recognized a loss of $1.8
 million in the quarter, versus a gain of $16.1 million in the
 first quarter of 1995, on its hedge positions.   Although EOG
 recognized a loss for the first quarter of 1996, EOG has locked
 in a gain on its hedges of $17.4 million for the remaining quarters
 of 1996.  Likewise Enron Corp. has locked in  a gain of $2.4 million
 on its hedges for the remaining quarters of 1996.  This income,
 in addition to the company's ability to now benefit from increasing
 natural gas prices, should more than offset the losses recognized
 in the first quarter.&quot;
 <P>
  EOG's total wellhead natural gas delivered volumes averaged 848
 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of gas in the first quarter
 of 1996, up 18 percent, compared to 716 MMcf/d a year ago, reflecting
 increases in North America and Trinidad.  Average North America
 wellhead natural gas prices received by EOG were $1.74 per thousand
 cubic feet (Mcf) for the first quarter of 1996, up 36 percent,
 compared to $1.28 per Mcf a year ago.  EOG's crude oil and condensate
 volumes increased 18 percent to 21.4  thousand barrels per day
 (MBD) in the first quarter of 1996 from 18.1 MBD a year ago. 
 The increase primarily reflects higher volumes in Trinidad that
 averaged 7.1 MBD  during the most recent quarter.
 <P>
  Enron Corp., the world's first natural gas major with approximately
 $13 billion in assets, operates one of the largest natural gas
 transmission systems in the world; is the largest purchaser and
 marketer of natural gas and the largest non-regulated marketer
 of electricity in North America; produces and markets natural
 gas liquids worldwide; owns 60 percent of Enron Oil &amp; Gas
 Company, one of the largest independent (non-integrated) exploration
 and production companies in the United States; owns 52 percent
 of Enron Global Power &amp; Pipelines L.L.C., which is owner and
 manager of operating power plants and natural gas pipelines in
 emerging markets; and is one of the largest independent developers
 and producers of electricity in the world.  Enron Corp. is traded
 under the ticker symbol, &quot;ENE.&quot;
 <P>
 This press release includes forward looking statements
 within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933
 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Although
 Enron believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions,
 it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved.  Important
 factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
 those in the forward looking statements herein include political
 developments in foreign countries, the pace of deregulation of
 retail natural gas and electricity markets in the United States,
 the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for oil,
 gas, electricity and interest rates, the extent of EOG's success
 in acquiring oil and gas properties and in discovering, developing
 and producing reserves, the timing and success of Enron's efforts
 to develop international power, pipeline and other infrastructure
 projects and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets
 during the periods covered by the forward looking statements.</FONT>
