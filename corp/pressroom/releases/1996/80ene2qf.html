<h4>ENRON CORP. REPORTS 24 PERCENT INCREASE IN SECOND QUARTER 1996 NET INCOME TO $116.7 MILLION, OR $.46 PER SHARE</h4>


<!-- this is where the body of the press release goes-->
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Thursday, July 11, 1996</p>

<p>HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. today reported a 24 percent increase in net 
income to $116.7 million for the second quarter of 1996, or $.46 per share 
after preferred dividends compared to 1995 second quarter net income of $94.0 
million, or $.37 per share after preferred dividends.</p>

<p>Revenues were $3.0  billion in the second quarter of 1996, compared 
to $2.1 billion in 1995.</p>

<p>"Each of Enron's business units performed well in the second quarter 
of 1996, resulting in strong earnings company wide," said Kenneth L. Lay, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Corp. "Consistent performance 
from the interstate natural gas pipelines, strong natural gas and electricity 
marketing volumes, steady progress by our international businesses and strong 
volumes and prices for Enron Oil & Gas Company (EOG) are primary factors 
for our success in the second quarter, and we continue to be well positioned 
to achieve our goal of an average compound earnings growth rate of at least 
15 percent over the next five years."</p>

<p>For the first half of 1996, Enron reported a 14 percent increase in 
net income to $329.5 million or $1.31 per share after preferred dividends. 
The amounts compare to net income of $289.0 million or $1.16 per share for 
the first six months of 1995. Revenues for the first half of 1996 were $6.0 
billion compared to $4.5 billion in the first half of 1995.</p>

<p>Enron Operations reported earnings before interest and taxes of 
$101.4 million in the second quarter of 1996, compared to $68.6 million a 
year ago.  Enron Operations' earnings include the commercial and operational 
aspects of Enron's U.S. interstate natural gas, natural gas liquids and 
crude oil pipelines as well as fees associated with engineering and 
construction services provided to third parties worldwide.</p>

<p>"Improved operations of the pipelines, including lower operating and 
maintenance costs on the interstate systems and stronger transportation 
volumes on the east end of Transwestern Pipeline resulted from Enron's dual 
commitment of meeting market needs while lowering costs," Lay said.   "In 
addition, Enron Operations' results in the recent quarter benefited by a 
strong performance from EOTT Energy Partners, L.P., compared to a  loss of 
$13.1 million pretax ($8.5 million after tax) recognized in the second 
quarter of 1995."</p>

<p>Enron Capital & Trade Resources (ECT), which encompasses the 
corporation's marketing, purchasing and financing of natural gas, natural 
gas liquids and power, reported earnings before interest and taxes of $52.1 
million in the second quarter of 1996, compared to $46.7 million a year ago.</p>

<p>"ECT's cash and physical, risk management and finance businesses all  
performed well in the second quarter," Lay said. "ECT's physical marketing 
volumes increased 11 percent in the second quarter of 1996 to 8.7 trillion 
British thermal units of energy equivalent per day (TBtue/d) compared to 
7.9 TBtue/d a year ago."</p>

<p>ECT's U.S. power marketing business reflected significant growth in 
the second quarter of 1996, with 11.0 million megawatt-hours sold, compared 
to 1.6 million megawatt-hours sold in the second quarter of 1995.</p>

<p>"ECT continues to maximize opportunities in the deregulated wholesale 
power market," Lay said.  "The company also is participating in one of the 
nation's first retail electricity pilot programs in New Hampshire and has 
signed contracts with four major industrial power customers in an Illinois 
pilot program.  Both programs provide ECT invaluable experience as it pursues 
similar retail activities in selected areas across the United States."</p>

<p>Enron International reported earnings before interest and taxes of 
$39.3 million in the second quarter of 1996 compared to $24.3 million a year 
ago.  Enron International includes earnings from the development and 
promotion of integrated energy projects, commercial power generation 
activities outside of North America and Enron Global Power & Pipelines L.L.C. 
(EPP).</p>

<p>"In its successful pursuit of new markets, Enron Development Corp. 
announced a 'Heads of Agreement' for a $161 million gas processing plant 
with the state oil and gas company of Vietnam in the second quarter of 1996," 
Lay said.  "In addition, the company's efforts to gain final clearances from 
the government of India to restart construction of the Dabhol Power Project 
are near completion, with the recent approval of the amended power purchase 
agreement by the newly formed national government in New Delhi."</p>

<p>"EPP also was active in the second quarter, acquiring Enron's 50 
percent interest in both a 357-mile natural gas pipeline system in Colombia 
and a 185-megawatt power project in the Dominican Republic," Lay said.</p>

<p>International results in the second quarter of 1996 include revenues 
of approximately $16.0 million from the sale of a portion of Enron's interest 
in Teesside Power Limited, effectively bringing Enron's ownership interest 
in the project to 35 percent.  Comparable results one year ago included 
revenues of $12.0 million recognized as a result of the partial satisfaction 
of Enron's support obligations related to the formation of EPP.</p>

<p>Exploration and Production earnings before interest, minority 
interest and taxes in the second quarter of 1996 were $76.9 million compared 
to $84.5 million a year ago, reflecting significantly lower property sales 
but much stronger volumes and prices.  As part of its strategy to maximize 
the economic value of its assets, EOG sold selected reserves and related 
assets in the second quarter of 1996 and 1995, resulting in pretax gains of 
$17.7 million and $53.7 million, respectively ($6.8 million and $27.9 
million, respectively, after tax and minority interest).</p>

<p>"Consistently low operating costs, higher crude oil and natural gas 
volumes and prices, and a strong outlook for EOG's wellhead natural gas 
prices and deliverability should result in a solid earnings performance for 
the full year 1996," Lay said. </p>

<p>EOG's total wellhead natural gas sales volumes averaged 840 million 
cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) in the second quarter of 1996, up 25 percent 
compared to 670 MMcf/d during the second quarter of 1995.  The average North 
American wellhead natural gas price received by EOG was $1.72 per thousand 
cubic feet (Mcf) for the second quarter of 1996 compared to $1.34 per Mcf a 
year ago.  EOG's crude oil and condensate volumes increased 10 percent to 
19.1 thousand barrels per day (MBD) in the second quarter of 1996 from 17.4 
MBD a year ago.  The increase primarily reflects higher volumes in Trinidad 
and India that averaged 5.4 MBD and 2.7 MBD, respectively, during the most 
recent quarter.</p>

<p>Corporate and Other in the second quarter of 1996 included a  $28.0 
million pretax gain ($18.2  million after tax) from the sale of 1.6 million 
EOG shares by Enron Corp.   Virtually all of the gain was offset by a $24.7 
million pretax reserve ($16.1 million after tax) established for litigation 
contingencies.</p>

<p>Enron Corp., one of the world's largest integrated natural gas 
companies with approximately $13 billion in assets, operates the largest 
natural gas transmission system in the Western Hemisphere and the second 
largest system in the world; is the largest purchaser and marketer of natural 
gas and the largest non-regulated marketer of electricity in North America; 
produces and markets natural gas liquids worldwide; owns 59 percent of Enron 
Oil & Gas Company, one of the largest independent (non-integrated) 
exploration and production companies in the United States; owns 59 percent of 
Enron Global Power & Pipelines L.L.C., which is owner and manager of 
operating power plants and natural gas pipelines in emerging markets; and is 
one of the largest independent developers and producers of electricity in 
the world. Enron Corp. is traded under the ticker symbol, "ENE."</p>

Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934.  Although Enron believes that its expectations are 
based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will 
be achieved.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ

and extent of changes in commodity prices for oil, gas, electricity and 
interest rates, the extent of EOG's success in acquiring oil and gas 
properties and in discovering, developing and producing reserves, the timing
