<!-- this is where the body of the press release goes-->
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Monday, January 13, 1997
<p>
HOUSTON -- Enron today announced an expanded management committee, along with recent management promotions and 
consolidation and expansion of certain business lines that will allow it to be more responsive to customer needs 
in domestic and international markets.<p>
The Office of the Chairman continues under the leadership of Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay, President and 
COO Jeffrey K. Skilling and Vice Chairman John A. Urquhart.<p>
Enron has consolidated its international activities, excluding exploration and production, into a newly formed 
business unit, Enron International (EI).  The company will develop, provide fuel supply, finance and operate all 
projects pursued in emerging markets through Enron Development Corp. (EDC), Enron Joint Venture Management, Enron 
Americas and through Enron's majority interest in Enron Global Power and Pipelines L.L.C. (EPP).  EI also will 
significantly expand Enron's traditional international asset and infrastructure development business by offering 
the merchant, finance and risk management products to third parties in emerging markets that Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources (ECT) has developed and marketed to its customers in North America and Europe.  Rebecca P. Mark, currently 
EDC chairman and CEO, will serve as chairman and CEO of EI, Joseph W. Sutton, currently EDC president and COO, will 
serve as president and COO of EI, and Rodney L. Gray, currently chairman, president and CEO of EPP, will add the
responsibilities 
of executive vice president of EI.<p>
Enron has separated activities previously under Enron Operations Corp. into two new business units. Stanley C. 
Horton has been named chairman and CEO of the newly formed Enron Gas Pipeline Group, which has responsibility for
 all 
of Enron&iacute;s North American pipeline companies. Horton also will serve as chairman and CEO for Enron Liquid 
Services
 Company, which manages Enron&iacute;s various liquids assets. Thomas E. White has been named chairman and CEO of 
 the newly
 formed Enron Ventures Corp. and will manage Enron's international and domestic engineering and construction 
 activities and
 expand those services to external clients.  Enron Ventures also will manage Enron's clean fuels operations and 
 investments
 and Enron&iacute;s investment in EOTT Energy Corp.<p>
Enron Capital & Trade Resources (ECT) is led by Jeffrey K. Skilling as chairman and CEO, in addition to his 
responsibilities
 as Enron president and COO, and Lou L. Pai as president and COO. Forrest E. Hoglund continues to serve as 
 chairman and CEO
 of Enron Oil & Gas Company and Mark G. Papa as president.<p>
Enron recently announced the formation of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. (EREC), whose chairman and CEO is Robert C.
 Kelly. EREC
 is responsible for Enron&iacute;s activities in the renewable energy market, including the development of solar
 energy power
 plants and wind energy farms.<p>
The Enron senior corporate management members continue to serve the company through both existing and newly created
 positions.
 Continuing in their respective positions are Edmund P. Segner III, executive vice president and chief of staff; 
 James V. Derrick,
 Jr., senior vice president and general counsel; Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and

 Affairs and Elizabeth A. Tilney, senior vice president, Marketing, Communications and Administration. <p>
Newly promoted were J. Cliff Baxter, formerly ECT managing director of corporate development, who has been promoted 
to senior vice
 president, corporate development; Richard A. Causey, formerly ECT managing director, who has been promoted to
 senior vice president
 and chief accounting and information officer;  Mark E. Koenig, formerly vice president of investor relations,
 who has been promoted
 to senior vice president of investor relations; and Steven J. Kean, formerly ECT vice president, who has been 
 promoted to senior vice
 president of government affairs.<p>
To optimize corporate-wide finance and funding activities, Enron has formed Enron Capital Management (ECM) to
 encompass Enron's treasury
 and corporate risk management functions as well as ECT's funding, capital pricing and management activities. 
 The company will be 
 responsible for pricing capital and funding for all of Enron's businesses. Andrew S. Fastow, formerly ECT 
 managing director, has been 
 promoted to senior vice president of Enron, overseeing the activities of ECM.<p>
All of the management represented in this announcement join Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay and President 
and COO Jeffrey K. Skilling
 on the Enron Management Committee, with the exceptions of Forrest Hoglund and Mark Papa, who serve as ad-hoc
 members.<p>
