<h4> ENRON ANNOUNCES FIRST METERING SYSTEMS USING TWO-WAY WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND A SATELLITE-ENABLED NETWORK FOR ALL ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS</h4> 
 <p>
<b>Strategic Alliances Links Enron, ABB, TransData, Motorola, Mtel and ARDIS 
To Offer A Revolutionary and Affordable Wireless Electricity Metering System</b>



<!-- this is where the body of the press release goes-->
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Monday, December 15, 1997
<p>
HOUSTON - Enron Energy Services, Inc. (EES), a subsidiary of Enron Corp., today announced agreements to launch the first-of-their-kind electric metering systems featuring two-way wireless communications and a satellite-enabled network for industrial, commercial and residential consumers in the deregulated marketplace. 
<p>
"We have selected the best-in-class companies to deliver a revolutionary and affordable automatic meter reading system," said Lou Pai, chairman and CEO of EES.  "California consumers are starting to see the benefits of the deregulating electricity industry.  Not only will deregulation give them lower power prices, but more importantly, they can expect to see new and innovative products and services like what we have announced today.  Our Interactive Meter Solution is a perfect example of how customers will be able to run their businesses and homes more efficiently and save money." 
<p>
Soon, customers in California will be able to execute a simple command from a remote phone, computer or two-way pager, to adjust the thermostat, turn on the lights, stereo and oven and control the security system in their homes. Plant managers will be alerted to midnight power surges or outages, potentially saving thousands of dollars by cutting their response time to process equipment failures that previously may have lingered indefinitely.  And, both residential and commercial customers will have the capability to more closely monitor and maximize their electricity savings with the Enron Interactive Metering Solution.
<p>&nbsp;
<center><b>The <i>Enron Interactive Metering Solution</i> for Residential Customers</b></center>
<p>
The residential metering communications system is comprised of Motorola FLEX&#153; two-way paging technology and Mobile Telecommunication Technologies' (Mtel) nationwide Advanced Messaging Network. No longer will meter readers be jumping fences to obtain data, but homeowners will soon have the ability to bring their homes into the 21<sup>st</sup> century by taking advantage of revolutionary technology. Enron intends to offer an Interactive Metering Solution to residential consumers in California as soon as the regulatory rules allow, which is currently scheduled for January,1999.
<p> 
"Deregulation presents companies such as Motorola, Enron and others with tremendous opportunities to provide cutting-edge, cost-effective solutions to consumers wanting increased energy efficiency," said Dr. Julie Shimer, vice president and general manager, Motorola FLEX Architecture Solutions Division.  "As technology such as FLEX two-way paging and wireless modems evolves into integrated components of innovative solutions such as the Enron Interactive Metering Solution, we realize that there are no marketplace limitations on where we can go from here.  That's exciting to us and beneficial to our customers."
<p>
"I am delighted Enron selected Mtel to provide the fixed wireless for their residential Interactive Metering Solution," said John N. Palmer, Mtel Chairman. "Beyond meter reading, the additional services Enron will deliver to their residential customers will require a national, cost-effective two-way data network.  We are convinced that the public is going to be genuinely surprised and excited over the innovative services available from Enron."
<p>
As states begin to deregulate their electricity industries, the Enron Interactive Metering Solution will provide a high-quality, low-cost, state-of-the-art technology system to all customers.
<p>&nbsp;
<center><b>The <i>Enron Interactive Metering Solution</i> for
Commercial and Industrial Customers</b></center>
<p>
For commercial and industrial customers, the system consists of ABB Alpha &#174; electronic meters and TransData, Inc.'s Mark-V industrial grade meters, fitted with Motorola Series 500 Integrated Wireless Modems and transmitted over the ARDIS nationwide data network. Because this is the first metering system with nationwide capabilities equipped with internal wireless modems, customers will no longer be responsible for costly dedicated phone lines and the associated monthly bills.
<p>
"Enron's Interactive Metering Solution, which includes ABB's Alpha &#174; meter technology, combines public available networks to further reduce energy costs and value-added services for the customer,"  said John Reckleff, executive vice president and general manager of ABB Information Systems. "Today, the Alpha &#174; meter is the number one electronic polyphase meter in North America.  These meter services allow you to monitor and manage your energy usage, receive automatic notification of outages, and track your service quality."
<p>
"The MARK-V, our fifth generation electric meter, establishes a new metering performance standard with the combination of a highly accurate digital measurement circuit and existing national two-way wireless network technology," said Edward Gleibs Jr., president of TransData, Inc.  "This open protocol gateway will give the Enron Interactive Metering Solution the capacity for automated meter reading of billing data, load profiles, power quality reports, outage notifications and other services."
<p>
Enron's broad distribution of the Interactive Metering Solution creates an economy of scale that allows customers to enjoy the benefits of this innovative technology without paying high unit costs. Meters offered by other utilities and energy companies can have a much higher price tag without the innovative technologies of the Interactive Metering Solution.  Each meter records multiple data pulses so that electricity, gas and water usage can be monitored by a single unit.  Through the ease of the internet, commercial customers will then have the capability to access a wealth of their stored data, for example to compare the energy usage of multiple store and plant locations. 
<p>
"It is a great win for ARDIS to be selected by Enron to participate in such an innovative and far-reaching service initiative," said Walt Purnell, president and chief executive officer, ARDIS.  "Enron evaluated the alternatives and chose ARDIS to help it change the rules of utility monitoring.  Leveraging ARDIS' superior in-building and nationwide network coverage, Enron will make meter reading more efficient and affordable, using the data it collects wirelessly to help its customers cut energy costs." 
<p>
California is the first state to allow energy service providers to install meters in all customer locations which use more than 20 kilowatts of electricity beginning in January, 1998.
