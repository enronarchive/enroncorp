<h4>
ENRON CORP. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER
1997 NET INCOME OF $0.44 PER SHARE
</h4>





<!-- this is where the body of the press release goes-->
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Tuesday, October 14, 1997
<p>
HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. today reported third quarter 1997 net income of $134 million, or 
primary earnings per share of $0.44, compared to net income of $123 million, or $0.48 per share, 
for the 1996 period. Revenues for the third quarter of 1997 were $5.8 billion compared to $3.2 
billion for the prior year quarter.
<p>
"The third quarter results reflect strong increases in earnings from our international 
operations and development businesses and our Enron Capital &amp; Trade Resources businesses," 
said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron. "All of our business units 
made excellent progress on key activities that are building value for investors and contributing to 
Enron's long-term growth strategies."
<p>
<b>Regulated Operations</b>
<p>
<b><li>Gas Pipeline Group/Ventures</b>
<p>
This group includes earnings from Enron Gas Pipeline Group (GPG), which operates Enron's 
North American interstate natural gas pipelines, and Enron Ventures Corp. (EVC), which is 
responsible for Enron's engineering and construction activities as well as Enron's interests in 
clean fuels and EOTT Energy Partners, L.P.
<p>
GPG/EVC reported earnings before interest and taxes of $80 million in the third quarter of 
1997 compared to earnings of $98 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in earnings 
primarily reflects lower results related to the Transwestern Pipeline system, as well as lower 
results from EOTT Energy Partners, L.P.
<p>
All of Enron's interstate pipeline expansion projects are on track to meet scheduled in-service 
dates. Northern Border Pipeline began construction on the Chicago Project, which will bring an 
additional 700 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of Canadian natural gas into U.S. markets 
beginning November 1998. Transwestern Pipeline amended a previous expansion filing with the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to increase incremental capacity from 115 MMcf/d to 
200 MMcf/d on the Ignacio, Colorado, to Blanco, New Mexico line. The 85 MMcf/d addition is 
already fully subscribed. The expansion will also add 130 MMcf/d of capacity from Blanco to 
Thoreau, New Mexico.
<p>
<b><li>Portland General Electric</b>
<p>
Portland General Electric (PGE) provides retail electricity services to customers in the 
northwest Oregon service territory. PGE reported earnings before interest and taxes of $51 
million in the third quarter of 1997, the first quarter that Portland General has been consolidated 
with Enron's financial results. The strong earnings reflected the addition of nearly 4,000 
customers during the quarter, along with increased sales to commercial and industrial customers.
<p>
In September, PGE filed a Customer Choice Plan with the Oregon Public Utility 
Commission, calling for the separation of its regulated transmission and distribution businesses 
from its potentially competitive electricity sales, customer service and generation businesses in 
order to establish a competitive market for electricity in its service area and give its 681,000 
customers control over who supplies their electricity.
<p>
<b>Capital &amp; Trade Resources</b>
<p>
Enron Capital &amp; Trade Resources' (ECT) earnings are derived from the marketing, 
purchasing and financing of natural gas, power and natural gas liquids in North America and 
Europe, as well as from the company's operation of non-regulated pipelines and storage facilities.
<p>
ECT reported earnings before interest and taxes of $98 million in the third quarter of 1997 
compared to $74 million for the same period in 1996. The strong 1997 results reflect successful 
origination activities as well as earnings from ECT’s portfolio of capital investments. Physical 
volumes in the third quarter of 1997 increased 10 percent to 12.4 trillion British thermal units of 
energy equivalent per day (TBtue/d) compared to 11.3 TBtue/d a year ago. Power marketing 
volumes increased to 72.3 million megawatt hours (MWhs) sold in the third quarter of 1997, up 
287 percent compared to 18.7 million MWhs sold in the third quarter of 1996.
<p>
<b>Retail Energy Services</b>
<p>
Enron Energy Services (EES), which serves U.S. retail natural gas customers and will serve 
retail electricity customers when those markets begin to open up to competition on January 1, 
1998, reported a loss of $25 million, or $.06 per share (after tax), in the third quarter of 1997. 
The expected loss recognized by EES reflects the significant investments in the product 
development, regulatory and branding effort of positioning Enron to aggressively compete at the 
retail level.
<p>
In October, Enron filed The Choice Plan in Pennsylvania, which proposes to offer 
Philadelphia consumers a real choice of their electricity suppliers by creating an environment 
where retail marketers like EES can compete for new business beginning September 1, 1998.
<p>
<b>International Operations and Development</b>
<p>
International Operations and Development earnings consist of earnings from the development 
and promotion of integrated energy projects, commercial power generation, and pipeline and 
merchant activities outside of North America, including earnings from Enron Global Power &amp; 
Pipelines (EPP).
<p>
International reported earnings before interest, minority interest and taxes of $65 million in 
the third quarter of 1997 compared to $38 million in the third quarter of 1996. The quarter's 
strong performance reflected an increase in earnings from Enron's portfolio of capital 
investments in addition to increased international merchant activities.
<p>
In August 1997, Enron finalized an agreement with the EPP board of directors whereby EPP 
would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron at a purchase price of $35 in Enron common 
stock for each share of EPP common stock. Pending SEC review and shareholder approval, the 
merger could close in November 1997.
<p>
As an example of the integration of its development and merchant skills into a single project, 
Enron International won a bid to provide 1,000 megawatts of electricity that will be transported 
from Argentina to Brazil. Enron is finalizing a 20-year power purchase agreement with the 
Brazilian regional utilities, Eletrosul and Furnas, with power delivery expected by the fourth 
quarter of 1999. The bid includes the construction of electric transmission lines and a conversion 
station to allow the two countries' power grids to be connected for the first time.
<p>
<b>Exploration and Production/Enron Oil &amp; Gas Company</b>
<p>
Exploration and Production reported earnings before interest, minority interest and taxes of 
$49 million in the third quarter of both 1997 and 1996.  
<p>
Enron Oil &amp; Gas Company's (EOG) total North America equivalent production increased 
15 percent in the third quarter of 1997 compared to the third quarter of 1996. North America 
natural gas production averaged 748 MMcf/d in the third quarter of 1997 compared to 670 
MMcf/d in the third quarter of 1996. Total third quarter 1997 natural gas production averaged 
897 MMcf/d compared to 774 MMcf/d in the third quarter of 1996.
<p>
Total third quarter 1997 crude oil and condensate production averaged 20.6 thousand barrels 
per day (MBbl/d) compared to 17.7 MBbl/d in the third quarter of 1996.  North America crude 
oil and condensate production averaged 14.8 MBbl/d in the third quarter of 1997 compared to 
10.8 MBbl/d in the third quarter of 1996.
<p>
In the third quarter, an EOG subsidiary signed agreements with the China National 
Petroleum Corporation for the appraisal of potential development of crude oil and natural gas 
reserves within the Chuanzhong Block situated in one of China's oldest producing areas in the 
central Sichuan Province. EOG holds a 100 percent working interest in and will operate the 
fields.
<p>
<b>Corporate and Other</b>
<p>
Corporate and Other reported a loss of $15 million in the third quarter of 1997 compared to 
earnings of $3 million in the third quarter of 1996, net of the EPP minority interest in 1997. The 
third quarter of 1996 included gains of $11 million, or $0.02 per share after tax, related to the 
sale of EOG stock held by Enron.
