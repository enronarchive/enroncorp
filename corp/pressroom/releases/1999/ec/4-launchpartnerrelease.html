<!--- PRESSRELDATE 04-19-1999 --->

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Monday, April 19, 1999<p>
<b>PORTLAND, Ore.</b> - Enron Communications, Inc., a leader in the delivery of high bandwidth application services, announced today eight pioneering distribution partners that will deploy Enron’s ePowered™ Application Services to users of the World Wide Web.
<p>

<p>
These launch distribution partners -- GTE Internetworking, Verio, Epoch Internet, NorthPoint Communications, InterNAP Network Services, EasyStreet Online Services, Electric Lightwave, and TeleCommute Solutions -- are connecting to the Enron Intelligent Network and will be capable of delivering Enron Communications’ first application service, ePowered Media Cast™, to users on the World Wide Web.  ePowered Media Cast delivers streaming video to the desktop at an average bit-rate speed of 200 kbps – 10 times faster than what is currently available on the public Internet.
<p>

<p>
“Enron Communications has developed a unique business model that is very beneficial to ISPs, CLECs and other Network Service Providers with high-speed connections to their customers," said Joe Hirko, president and CEO of Enron Communications, Inc.  “Not only do we offer our distribution partners end-to-end quality of service for streaming rich media over the Enron Intelligent Network, but we provide new revenue streams and a significantly differentiated product offering that Internet users want and need.  Our distribution partners play a vital role in our vision of enhancing the end-user's experience of the Internet."
<p>

<p>
The Enron Intelligent Network is an application delivery platform enabled with InterAgent&#174;, an intelligent messaging software that enables Enron Communications' existing pure Internet Protocol (IP) fiber-optic network to create next generation application services. IP is the optimal network protocol for digital communications.  Using a distributed server architecture, developed in alliance with Sun Microsystems, the Enron Intelligent Network is designed to store information and application services just one hop away from end-users.  By limiting the number of routers each transaction passes through, the network is reliable, fast and efficient.
<p>

<p>
Applications that have been optimized to take advantage of the Enron Intelligent Network are called "ePowered."  By design, ePowered application services are delivered to Enron Communications’ point of presence (POP) in distribution partners’ cities.  By connecting to the Enron Intelligent Network, distribution partners can offer ePowered application services to their business customers.  This service model allows distribution partners to immediately differentiate their service by offering broadband optimized streaming multimedia content and applications to users of the World Wide Web.  Enron Communications’ first ePowered application service -- ePowered Media Cast™ -- will dramatically improve the experience of the Internet by delivering up to broadcast quality streaming rich media to the desktop.
<p>

<p>
Network expansion will continue through December 2000. The Enron Intelligent Network currently covers Portland, San Francisco/San Jose, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, Washington, DC and New York.
