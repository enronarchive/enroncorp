			The precursor to today's wholesale trading business in North America and Europe, 
			GasBank, is launched and Enron begins trading natural gas commodities.  After 
			the deregulation of the U.S. natural gas industry, the market has to revise its 
			methods of contracting for gas in the wholesale market.  GasBank allows producers 
			and wholesale buyers to purchase firm gas supplies and hedge the price risk of 
			the new spot market at the same time.  Today, Enron is the largest natural gas 
			merchant in North America and the U.K.
