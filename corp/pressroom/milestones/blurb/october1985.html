			FERC Order 436 is issued.  Enron's interstate pipelines work to become open-access transporters to allow other entities to transport on our pipelines.  Northern Natural Gas successfully transitions to an open-access transportation company through favorable settlements with its customers and the resolution of approximately 5,000 gas purchase contracts, with minimal impact to shareholders between 1986 and 1993.  The majority of NNG's settlements on these take-or-pay contracts take place between 1988 and 1990.
