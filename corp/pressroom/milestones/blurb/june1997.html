Enron acquires Portland General Electric (PGE).
<p>
Enron announces the settlement of all contractual issues involving the J-Block contract in the U.K. North Sea. Enron records a second quarter non-recurring charge to income of $450 million after tax reflecting the full accounting for the effects of the amended contract under current market conditions.  The settlement allows the gas to be taken at consistent volumes, assuring a significant long-term supply at favorable fixed prices.
