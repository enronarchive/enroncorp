<font color="#0066cc"><b>Most Innovative Company, 1996-2001</b><br></font>
For an unprecedented six consecutive years, Enron has been named "America's Most
Innovative Company" by Fortune in its annual survey.  Enron placed No. 18 overall on
the list of the nation's 535 "Most Admired Companies" and ranked among the top five
in "Quality of Management," "Quality of Products/Services" and "Employee Talent."
<p>
<font color="#0066cc"><b>"100 Best Companies to Work for in America," 1999, 2000, and 2001</b><br></font>
Enron is No. 22 on Fortune's annual list of best corporate workplaces.  More than
two hundred companies took part in the selection process that included a human
resources questionnaire, a culture audit and a confidential survey that was sent
to randomly selected employees.
<p>
<font color="#0066cc"><b>FT Energy Global Awards, 2000</b><br></font>
Enron received two prestigious awards from Financial Times Energy.  As the recipient
of the group's most valued award, "Energy Company of the Year," Enron was recognized
for its overall excellence, innovation, and environmental concern.  Enron also received
the award for the "Boldest Successful Investment Decision" for EnronOnline.  With this
award, FT Energy acknowledges Enron's entrepreneurial skill in creating and launching
a global, easy-to-transact Internet-based system for buying and selling commodities.
<p>
<font color="#0066cc"><b>Fortune's All-Star List of Global Most Admired Companies -- 2000</b><br></font>
Enron ranks No. 25 on Fortune's all-star list of companies that
"demonstrate a new-economy-style growth strategy while maintaining an
old-economy approach to fiscal responsibility."  Fortune also named
Enron the most innovative company in the world and ranked it second in
ability to attract, develop and retain talent.  According to Fortune,
the key to survival in the new economy is innovation and "No company
illustrates the transformative power of innovation more dramatically
than Enron," citing Enron's market-making capabilities and the success of
EnronOnline.  Fortune evaluated companies in 27 industries from around
the world, compiling feedback from executives, board members and analysts.
In addition to innovativeness and the ability to attract and keep people,
companies were judged on quality of management; quality of products and
services; long-term investment value; financial soundness; community
responsibility; use of corporate assets; and global business acumen.
<p>
<font color="#0066cc"><b>100 Fastest-Growing Companies</b><br></font>
Enron ranks 29th on Fortune's list of "speed racers of the economy."
Enron was cited for continuing to reinvent itself with such eCommerce
efforts as EnronOnline, with more than 900 products transacted with
customers worldwide, and for our broadband services business.  To qualify,
companies must be U.S.-based, be in operation for three years and have
revenues and a market capitalization of at least $50 million.  To make
the list, companies must achieve a 30 percent growth rate for three years
in both revenue and earnings per share (EPS), with positive earnings in
the latest quarter.  Those companies are then ranked by growth in revenue,
EPS and total stock-market return over a three-year period.
<p>
<font color="#0066cc"><b>Ten Stocks to Last the Decade</b><br></font>
Long-term investors, pay attention.  Enron is one of 10 growth stocks you
might want to add to and hold in your investment portfolio, according to
the August 14 issue of Fortune magazine.  What do Enron and the other nine
companies have in common?  Just this: "They all share exceptional management
and an ability to execute no matter what happens in the macro-economy."
The success of EnronOnline and the company's potential in broadband services
make Enron a winning stock wager in the long term.
<p>
<font color="#0066cc"><b>Fortune Global 500 - World's Largest Corporations 2000</b><br></font>
Fortune named Enron the 62nd largest corporation in the world, up from
No. 85 in 1999.  Enron is also the No. 1 company in the magazine's Energy
category.  With the gulf growing wider between new economy and old economy
companies, Enron's eCommerce efforts, such as EnronOnline, mark it as a
company on the cutting-edge in the global e-business marketplace.  "The
rapid pace of technological change is forcing a continuous level of investment
in emerging sectors," said Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch.
<p>
<font color="#0066cc"><b>Energy/Commodity Derivatives House of the Year - 1999</b><br></font>
Enron wins this award "because of its ability to take a lead in
new areas of risk management," most notably the launch of EnronOnline,
the company's Internet-based trading system for wholesale energy
and other commodities, according to Risk magazine. 
<p>
<font color="#0066cc"><b>World's Best Global Companies</b><br></font>
Global Finance named Enron the world's best global company
in the energy sector in its September 1999 issue. Winning companies
were selected based on how well they are managed, their impact on
competitors, return on invested capital and global reach. 
<p>
<font color="#0066cc"><b>World's Leading Power Company, 1999</b><br></font>
Forbes Global Business magazine ranked Enron the top power
company in the world in its inaugural A-list companies this year.
The magazine cited Enron's broad market presence, integrated energy
network and commitment to energy-starved nations such as India.
Enron's achievements in gas and power marketing and advocacy for
regulatory change across all electricity markets also received high
marks. 
<p>
<font color="#0066cc"><b>The New Blue Chips, 1999</b><br></font>
In 1998, Wired magazine introduced the Wired
Index, which is a list of 40 new blue chip
companies that represent the U.S. information economy. Wired
editors continue to track the companies that are building the new
economy. Enron was selected because it aggressively uses information
technology to drive the organization's goals and expand its businesses.
<p>            
<font color="#0066cc"><b>America's Best Sales Force, 1999</b><br></font>
Sales &amp; Marketing Management's annual survey ranked Enron's
sales force as the best in the nation for 1999.
