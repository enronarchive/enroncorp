<b><p>To:  All FGT Customers</p>

<p>Re:  Notice Regarding FGT Currently Effective Tariff</p>
</b>
<p>FGT maintains a FERC approved tariff on its website as required by Commission regulations.  From time-to-time, FGT makes filings with the FERC proposing to change provisions contained in FGT’s tariff.  The tariff sheets contained in such filings become effective only after the Commission issues an order accepting the tariff sheets.  FGT does not update its tariff contained on this website until an order has been issued by the Commission approving such tariff sheets.  Because FGT does not update its tariff until receiving a Commission order, it is possible that during certain periods the FERC approved tariff provisions regarding rates and fuel shown on the FGT website will be different from the rates and fuel shown on our Informational Postings site under "Rates" which FGT has posted for its customers convenience in anticipation of FERC approval of pending filings.  <b>FGT’s invoices will reflect the FERC approved rates and customers are responsible for paying invoiced amounts.</p>
