    deliver their gas. You may enter your nominations electronically on the HotTap system or <a href="etfr_ediguides.html" target="_top">EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)</a>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Nomination system is the medium through which FGT
    customers request a specific service on FGT. A nomination is a specific request for
    service that is tied to one and only one contract. The nomination states a date range,
    point locations, quantities, priorities, and upstream/downstream contract <strong>and
    third party DUNS </strong>information. In other words, a nomination clearly identifies the
    amount of gas a shipper expects to transport on the FGT pipeline subject to the terms and
    conditions of the contract under which the service is being requested. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the scheduling process, the pipeline balances all
    logical pool points and cuts are then made across contracts back to the physical receipts
    &amp; deliveries using the ranks &amp; priorities of the shippers at the time of
    nominations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Currently FGT has <strong>five</strong> nominations cycles
    that are available to shippers to submit nominations<br>

    upcoming gas day beginning at 9:00 a.m.<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The electronic notice will be brief; it will inform you

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When FGT&#146;s system integrity is in jeopardy, FGT may
    issue an Alert Day notice, which may cover the entire FGT system or cover only a certain
    area of the system (&#147;Affected Area&#148;). FGT will give notice of an Alert Day by
    sending a fax or calling affected parties, as well as by posting the notice on its website
    under &#147;Critical Notices&#148;. Customers will be advised as to whether the notice is
    for an Overage Alert Day or an Underage Alert Day, and the Gas Day affected. An Overage
    Alert Day usually means that line pack is low and customers should not take more than
    their scheduled delivery quantities from the system. An Underage Alert Day usually means
    that line pack is high and customers should not take less than their scheduled delivery
    quantities from the system. Alert Day notices also will state a tolerance level which
    cannot be less than the greater of 2% or 500 mmbtu. Out-of-tolerance quantities are
    settled at either 200% of the highest posted price for quantities due FGT, or 50% of the
    lowest posted price for quantities due the customer. For more information on Alert Days,
    please see Section 13.D of the FGT tariff (Sheet nos. 128 through 129A). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><a name="OF">OFO</a></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Operational Flow Orders (OFO) are issued by FGT to specific
    customers to alleviate a condition that could threaten FGT&#146;s ability to meet it
    contractual commitments to other firm shippers. OFO&#146;s are usually issued when line
    pack conditions are either too high or too low, and a specific customer&#146;s current
    take levels are responsible for, or exacerbating, the condition. The OFO notice will
    advise the customer of the specific action that the customer is to take, and will be in
    terms of hourly or daily gas flow levels, and will specify a discrete length of time the
    OFO will be in effect. OFO&#146;s will be issued by fax and by telephone calls to the
    customer&#146;s designated Contact Person. The penalty for failure to comply with an OFO
    is $10 per mmbtu times the quantity by which the customer deviated from the requirements
    of the OFO. For more information on Operational Flow Orders, please see Section 17.C.3 of
    the FGT tariff (Sheet nos. 161 through162A). </font></td>
