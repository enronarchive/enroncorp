You no doubt have been following the news reports about Enron Corp's financial issues and Dynegy’s notice of termination of the merger agreement between Enron and Dynegy.  FGT is a separate and distinct company from Enron Corp with a separate and distinct credit rating.  FGT has been, and continues to be, solvent.  We want to assure you that all FGT business and related activities, including FGT’s Phase V Expansion project and other construction projects, will continue in the ordinary course of business, regardless of Enron's actions.</p>
