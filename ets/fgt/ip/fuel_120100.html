<title>NOTICE REGARDING FUEL RATE EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2000</title>
</head>
<body>

<b><p>To: All FGT Customers</p>

<p>RE:  FGT Fuel Rate Effective December 1, 2000</p>
</b>
<p>On August 31, 2000, FGT filed to establish a Base Fuel Reimbursement Charge Percentage (&quot;Base FRCP&quot;) of 3.14% to become effective for the six-month Winter Period beginning October 1, 2000, and on October 23, 2000, filed a flex adjustment of (0.39)% to establish an Effective Fuel Reimbursement Charge (&quot;Effective FRCP&quot;) of 2.75% effective November 1, 2000.</p>

<p>Subsequently, on November 7, 2000, FGT filed in Docket No. RP01-82-000 to reduce the Base FRCP from 3.14% to 2.50%, effective December 1, 2000.  The November 7, 2000 filing is pending before the Commission.  Additionally, on November 14, 2000, FGT filed a flex adjustment of (0.25)% which, when combined with the <u>proposed</u> Base FRCP of 2.50%, results in an Effective FRCP of 2.25% to be effective December 1, 2000.  FGT is filing these adjustments to reflect the lower fuel usage currently being experienced on its system.  Pursuant to the terms of FGT’s tariff, the November 14 flex adjustment will become effective without prior FERC approval provided that the FERC approves FGT’s November 7 filing.  FGT anticipates the FERC will approve the November 7 filing prior to December 1, 2000.</p>

<p>Shippers should assume an Effective FRCP of 2.25% when nominating transportation quantities for December 2000.</p></body>
