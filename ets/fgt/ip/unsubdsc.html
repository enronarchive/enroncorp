				FGT currently has no mainline capacity from the Western Division supply area into 
				the Market Area in the state of Florida which can be subscribed to firm service on 
				an annual basis.  Pockets of capacity may exist on laterals or on FGT's mainline 
				from time to time between certain points or during certain seasons.
				<br><br>
				Unsubscribed point capacity (total meter capacity in excess of primary firm 
				obligations) exists at all of FGT's receipt points except NGPL-Jefferson - DRN 
				23703 (fully subscribed November through April).  Unsubscribed receipt point 
				capacity may or may not be available for subscription depending upon downstream 
				constraints on supply laterals or on FGT's mainline.  In addition, supplies 
				available at a receipt point may be substantially less than meter capacity 
				because of the pressure differentials existing from time to time at pipeline 
				interconnects and/or lack of gas supply at interconnects with processing plants, 
				gathering systems, or production wells.
				<br><br>
				Unsubscribed point capacity also exists at all of FGT's Western Division delivery 
				points and all of FGT's Market Area delivery points except Tallahassee-Hopkins 
				- DRN 3104, Tallahassee-Prudom - DRN 3282, FGU-Gainesville North - DRN 2940, 
				Kissimmee-Generating - DRN 3225, and TECO PGS-Orlando Southwest - DRN 3098.  
				Unsubscribed delivery point capacity may or may not be available for subscription 
				depending upon upstream constraints on delivery laterals or on FGT's mainline.  
				The addition of Market Area delivery points as primary delivery points under a 
				firm transportation agreement requires the written consent of the delivery point 
				operator.
				<br><br>
				As a result of the telescoping nature of FGT's mainline, and constraints on the 
				mainline and on supply and delivery laterals, requests for incremental firm 
				transportation capacity and for changes to primary receipt and delivery points 
				must be processed on a case by case specific basis.  Such requests should be 
				submitted pursuant to the provisions contained in FGT's FERC Gas Tariff, Third 
				Revised Volume No. 1.
