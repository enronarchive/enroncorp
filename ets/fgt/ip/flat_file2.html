<p>Re:  FGT Commerce Site / EDI Quick Response </p>

</b><p>As a reminder, Florida Gas Transmission would like to take this opportunity to follow up on the customer notification dated, October 12, 2000.  In this notice, we stated FGT's plans to discontinue the FGT Flat File process. </p>
<p>Beginning Friday, Jan. 5, 2001, the Quick Response link on FGT's Commerce site will be removed and will no longer be active.  Customers can access and view Quick Response information in our online Nominations / Scheduling system (TMS) within the Hottap website at: "www.hottap.enron.com", FGT Customer Activities, under Nominations , /EDI/EDM Quick Response. </p>
<p>In addition, FGT has targeted the end of the first quarter to de-implement the FGT Commerce and Test sites which will no longer be available to our customers. With all FGT customers now converted to the online TMS system, the information that was located in the Commerce site will be located either in the TMS system, or on the FGT Customer Activities HotTap site.  All valid information such as DUN's information and Transit Activity code links will be moved to the FGT's Customer Activities HotTap site.</p>
<p>We will follow up with our customers and keep you updated as we draw closer to the de-implementation date of the FGT Commerce and Test sites</p>
<p>If you have any questions on this matter please contact your FGT Market Service Representative.</p></body>
