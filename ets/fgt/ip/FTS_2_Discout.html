<p align="JUSTIFY">FGT’s Phase IV Expansion is nearing completion and will be in service on May 1, 2001 as anticipated.  Pursuant to the Stipulation and Agreement in Docket Nos. CP99-94-000 and RP96-366-000, <i>et. al</i>., filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&quot;FERC&quot;) on June 2, 1999 (&quot;Settlement&quot;), all shippers which both (1) held permanent FTS-2 capacity as of the date of the Settlement or who have entered into an FTS-2 Service Agreement to become effective upon the in-service date of the Phase IV Expansion, and (2) either supported or did not oppose the Settlement will receive certain rate caps resulting in discounts commencing on the in-service date of the expansion.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The specific provisions regarding the Phase IV rate caps and discounts can be found in Section II. Rate Provisions of the Settlement.  The parties eligible for these rate caps and/or discounts are identified on Attachment A to the Settlement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">FGT’s web site and rate cards will continue to reflect the FERC approved maximum tariff rates applicable to Rate Schedule FTS-2 (reservation 76.18¢/dth; usage 1.42¢/dth), but you will be billed at the discounted rates pursuant to the Settlement.</p>
