</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on customer feedback, FGT is pleased to announce that on December 15, 2000, FGT will be updating our Informational Postings web site<b>.</b>  We have added several new informational areas such as FGT Services, EDI information, and photograph of FGT Market Service Representative team.  With this feature, you will be able to view the FGT team picture and click in each individual Market Service Representative to view their contact information as well as utilize a direct email link to each Market Service Representative that supports your business.  </p>

<p>FGT would like to thank you in advance for you feedback as we continue to enhance our web sites.</p></body>
