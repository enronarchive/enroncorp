<p>To:  All Florida Gas Transmission Company Shippers</p>

<p>Re:  View All Pool Contract Enhancement</p>

</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an effort to provide better customer service information, Florida Gas Transmission Company is pleased to announce that effective December 17, 2000, we have modified the nomination maintenance screen and the shipper scheduled quantities screen for supply pool contracts to allow shippers to view all receipt and delivery nominations for <b>all</b> pools on a specific supply pool contract.</p>


<ul>
<li>To access this new <b>view all</b> option, open your supply pool contract from the nomination or scheduled quantities open box for the desired pool.  Click on the <b>View All</b> icon that is located in the title bar to activate the <b>view all</b> screen. The system will display all receipts and all deliveries for all pools on your supply pool contract. This screen is a view only screen with options to export, sort/group, and print.</li></ul>



<ul>
<li>To access the print function, select the <b>Print</b> icon on the title bar.</li></ul>



<ul>
<li>To preview the screen before you print, select the <b>Pview</b> icon on the title bar.</li></ul>



<ul>
<li>To access the data <b>sort </b>option and the sub-total <b>group</b> options, right mouse click in the data display portion of the screen to activate the sort/group functions. You may select the desired sort criteria from the list displayed on the screen.</li></ul>



<ul>
<li>To close the view all pool screen click on the cancel icon on the top right hand corner of the title bar. This will return you to the nomination maintenance screen to add new nominations or change existing nominations, or return you to the scheduled quantities screen to view schedule quantities for the desired gas day.</li></ul>


<p>Should you have any questions, or require additional information, please contact your Market Service Representative.  We hope this enhancement provides you with a better and faster process for doing business with FGT.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Julia Y. White</p>
