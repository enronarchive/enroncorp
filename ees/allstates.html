                    Legislation enacted in 1999 required retail electric competition to commence by January 2002.  In February 2001, Gov. Mike Huckabee signed SB 236 which delays retail electric competition until October 2003 and gives the Public Service Commission ("PSC") the authority to delay until October 2005.  In July 2001, the PSC opened an investigation to determine whether retail competition should be further delayed to 2005.  The PSC's findings will be further reported to the General Assembly.

                      AB 1890 was enacted in September 1996 allowing retail electric 
                      competition to begin in March 1998. Following the transition 
                      period, utilities can purchase electricity from any independent

                      electric power and to resell the power to public utilities 
                      at no more than its acquisition cost. The bill created the

                      The Legislature enacted Study Bill 152 in May 1998. The 
                      measure created a<br>
                      29 member Advisory Panel to study the benefits of unbundling 
                      retail electric<br>
                      rates. The results of the study proved retail electric competition 
                      would raise<br>
                      rates for consumers and that competition was not in their 
                      best interest. The<br>

                      The Legislature enacted House Bill 5005 in April of 1998. The bill provided electric retail customers with the opportunity to choose an electric supplier in January 2000. The bill also requires utilities to provide standard offer service at a 10% rate reduction through 2004. Utilities must divest their generating assets in order to recover stranded costs.

                      a 6.5% rate reduction over a four-year period. Utilities 
                      are permitted to recover non-bypassable competition transition 
                      charges and net transition cost. Potomac Electric Power 
                      Company’s sell of generating assets in Maryland was approved;

                      In May 2000, Governor Bush issued an executive order creating a 17-member task force to study electric reliability and gas supply issues. The task force will conclude it's study with recommendations to the Governor in December 2001. In January 2001, the Florida Energy 20/20 Study Commission proposed a plan to restructure the wholesale electric market. To date, Florida has not enacted comprehensive legislation to unbundle electric rates. </p>

                      there is no anticipation that the issue will be pursued 
                      the following year. The<br>

                      as a result they<br>
                      released a report calling for the legislature to introduce

                      In March 1997, the Legislature passed HB 399, requiring 
                      the unbundling of<br>
                      costs by electric utilities, cooperatives and municipalities,

                      distribution<br>
                      components. The commission has required some of the utilities 
                      in the state to<br>
                      submit unbundled cost analyses. A legislative committee 
                      study found, that<br>
                      with some of the lowest electricity rates in the country, 
                      Idaho's electric<br>
                      consumers would not benefit from retail competition.</p>

                      IIn June of 1999, Senate Bill 24 was enacted to amend the 
                      Electric Choice and Rate Relief Act (HB362). The measure 
                      gives residential customers a 5% base rate cut in October 
                      2001. Originally, Commonwealth Edison was included in a 
                      four-stage phase-in process that began in October 1999. 
                      Under the amendment Commonwealth Edison must spend a minimum 
                      of $2 billion enhancing its transmission and distribution 
                      systems and $250 million to support environmental programs. 
                      Utilities are allowed to recover stranded cost through securitization 
                      and a competition transition charge that will be in place 
                      through December 2006. </p>

                      During the last three years, the General Assembly has considered 
                      electric<br>
                      competition proposals. A bill was introduced to restructure 
                      electricity with<br>
                      retail access by January 2001 and capped rates for customers

                      1999 through December 31, 2005. The bill did not pass. Since 
                      the state has<br>
                      fairly low electricity prices, the issue of restructuring 
                      is not a priority.</p>

                      Since, the legislation to open competition in October 2002 
                      failed in the 2000<br>
                      session, there seems to be little chance that the next session 
                      will bring<br>
                      success. Iowans already have such low energy prices it's 
                      difficult to gain<br>
                      support for an electric restructuring bill. Other reasons 
                      for restructuring<br>
                      resistance are how to protect worker benefits in case of 
                      divestiture and<br>
                      consumer protection issues.</p>

                      The 2000 legislative session failed to debate or pass any of their introduced retail competition bills. Senator Ranson stated that deregulation could bring higher rates for residential customers, but that legislators should move toward open access before its becomes federally mandated.

                      The study urges<br>
                      against retail choice since electric prices are so low, 
                      but the task force will<br>
                      continue to monitor the issue. The task force believes customers 
                      would end<br>
                      up paying more over the next ten years for electricity because 
                      utilities would<br>

                      In February 1999, the Louisiana Public Service Commission ("PSC") determined that electric competition was not in the public interest at that time.  In January 2001, the PSC opened a proceeding to evaluate restructuring of the retail electric market.  Interested parties have submitted comments and PSC Staff has recommended that industrial customers be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers beginning 01/01/03.  Although the PSC Staff did not recommend PSC approval of retail choice for small commercial and residential customers at this time, PSC Staff has suggested that this be re-evaluated at a future date.</p>

                      in May of 1997, making this option possible. The act requires

Under SB 7, cooperatives and municipals can opt-in or opt-out at their discretion.  A rate freeze went into effect 9/01/99 and will expire 12/31/01.  A 6% rate reduction will go into effect at the start of competition, which begins 01/01/02.  Prior to the start of competition, IOUs must split into 3 separate companies:  (1) regulated transmission and distribution company; (2) unregulated power generation company; and (3) unregulated retail electric provider.  The pilot program was scheduled to begin 06/01/01 but has been delayed due to computer problems.  A maximum of 5% of a utility's load in each customer class can participate.  The maximum participation limits have not been met for the residential segment of the market.  However, more than the maximum 5% of commercial and industrial customers volunteered, so actual participants were chosen through a lottery process.</p>
                    <p> <b>Utah</b><br>
                      Lawmakers in Utah have adopted a &quot;go slow&quot; approach 
                      toward electric<br>
                      restructuring. Their preference is to observe restructuring 
                      and the expeReinces<br>
                      gained in other states prior to the passage of restructuring 
                      legislation.</p>
                    <p> <b>Vermont</b><br>
                     During the 2001 Vermont legislative session which ended June 4th, several measures were introduced to unbundle electric rates. Due to the lack of support, however, the legislature failed to enact a comprehensive retail electric bill.  The Governor’s working group, the Public Service Commission (PSC) and state’s jurisdictional utilities have spent a considerable amount of time addressing the questions surrounding the unbundling of electric rates and the impact it would have on consumers. The result is the same each time; Vermont will take the “go slow” approach.

                    <p> <b>Virginia</b><br>
                      In March 1999, Virginia’s governor signed Senate Bill 1269. 
                      The measure allows retail electric competition to be phased-in 
                      over a two-year period beginning in January 2002. Rates 
                      will be capped through mid-2007 and all incumbent utilities 
                      must separate transmission, distribution, and generation 
                      by 2002. The commission has released rules for utilities’ 
                      participation, proposed rules to implement the functional 
                      separation requirements, and interim rules for electric/gas 
                      retail pilot program. The pilot program has two phases: 
                      the first took place in 06/00 and 37,000 customers had the 
                      opportunity to choose their retail providers; in the second 
                      phase, which began on 01/01, over 74,000 customers have 
                      been given the opportunity to expeReince retail choice.

                    <p> <b>Washington</b><br>
                      In 1998, following the trend of surrounding states, the 
                      Washington Legislature<br>
                      enacted Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill (ESSB) 6560. The 
                      bill required the<br>
                      WUTC and the Department of Community Trade and Economic 
                      Development<br>
                      to study the benefits of retail electric competition on 
                      Washington's electric<br>
                      system. In 1999, the Commission and the Department submitted 
                      a report<br>
                      identifying those trends affecting the industry and consumers, 
                      and strategies<br>
                      for achieving policy objectives, however, there were no 
                      conclusions or<br>
                      recommendations made.</p>
                    <p> There is little expectation that a comprehensive electric 
                      unbundling measure<br>
                      will pass during the 2001 legislative session.</p>
                    <p> <b>West Virginia</b><br>
                      The Restructuring Task Force of West Virginia could not 
                      come to an agreement on a restructuring plan for the state. 
                      Therefore, the Commission ordered a proposed plan for electric 
                      utility restructuring, HR 27. With this bill customers will 
                      be able to select an alternative supplier beginning in mid-2001. 
                      Large customers will be able to choose their metering and 
                      billing service, as will residential customers within four 
                      years. Utilities will be permitted to sell, transfer, or 
                      assign their generation assets. Transmission and distribution 
                      rates will continue to be capped for six years, while utilities 
                      will be required to provide default service for six years.</p>
                    <p> <b>Wisconsin</b><br>
                      The state adopted a 7-step plan for implementing electric 
                      restructuring. But,<br>
                      the Public Service Commission postponed the implementation 
                      process<br>
                      because there were issues with reliability and inadequate 
                      wholesale<br>
                      competition.</p>
                    <p> <b>Wyoming</b><br>
                      In 1997, the Public Service Commission (PSC) initiated a 
                      series of workshops<br>
                      to evaluate the benefits of electric competition but subsequently 
                      cancelled the<br>
                      initiative after the Legislature expressed concern. Since 
                      that time, the PSC<br>
                      has not revisited the restructuring issue and may not for 
                      years to come.</p>
