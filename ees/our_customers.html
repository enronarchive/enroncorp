                    <p>EES has more than 31,000 customer facilities under contract 
                      across the U.S. EES serves customers in 50 U.S. states and 
                      five countries (U.S., Canada, U.K., Spain, Italy and Portugal). 
                      Customer space managed by EES across the U.S. is approx. 
                      3.1 billion sq. ft.
                    <p>Enron, ranked first in innovation in Fortune magazine's 
                      annual survey of America's Most Admired Companies for six 
                      years in a row, has proven its ability to bring innovative, 
                      integrated energy solutions to the marketplace. Below are 
                      some examples of the kinds of companies EES is serving:</p>
                    <p><br>
                      <b>National Retail Real Estate Investment Trust</b><br>
                      This EES customer is the nation's largest real estate investment 
                      trust (REIT) with over 260 properties in 36 states. With 
                      approximately 187 square feet of leasable area primarily 
                      in shopping malls and community shopping centers, it spends 
                      an average of $150 million per year on energy. In 1999, 
                      this company entered into a 10-year, $1.5 billion agreement 
                      with Enron Energy Services for total energy management. 
                      Through the agreement, Enron Energy Services procures electricity 
                      and natural gas; upgrades heating and cooling systems equipment 
                      where necessary; and maintains electrical systems including 
                      lighting. The partnership allows this customer to improve 
                      the shopping experience for tenants and customers.</p>
                    <p><b>Global Food and Beverage Company</b><br>
                      Many of the food and beverage brands of this EES customer 
                      have become household names over the last century. As one 
                      of the leaders in the food and beverage packaging market, 
                      80% of its annual sales come from North America. In early 
                      2001, Enron Energy Services and this company entered into 
                      a 10-year agreement for Enron Energy Services to manage 
                      its energy supply and oversee the operations and maintenance 
                      of its facilities in the United States and Canada. Outsourcing 
                      energy management to Enron will allow this customer to pursue 
                      future savings opportunities and fund branding-building 
                      activities.</p>
                    <p><b>National Retail Department Store Chain</b><br>
                      As one of the largest retail corporations in America, this 
                      EES customer is a leader in department stores, drug stores, 
                      and catalog and on-line sales. The company operates approximately 
                      1,075 department stores in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and 
                      Mexico. In April 2001, the company signed an energy management 
                      agreement with Enron Energy Services. Under the terms of 
                      the agreement, Enron will manage the supply of electricity 
                      at more than 1,250 this customer's locations in 50 states, 
                      as well as replace or update energy equipment to reduce 
                      consumption and create additional savings for it.</p>
                    <p><b>Global Pharmaceutical Company</b><br>
                      This EES Customer is a leader in the pharmaceutical industry. 
                      Based in Indianapolis, the company is developing a growing 
                      portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying 
                      the latest research from its worldwide laboratories and 
                      from collaboration with well-known research institutions. 
                      In February 2001, it signed at 15-year energy management 
                      agreement with Enron Energy Services. The relationship between 
                      the two companies will allow Enron to manage the supply 
                      of electricity and natural gas for the customer's facilities 
                      in Indiana, as well as perform operations and maintenance 
                      on energy assets and related energy infrastructure upgrades 
                      that will increase energy efficiency at its facilities. 
                      Ultimately, Enron 's energy management expertise will allow 
                      this customer to focus more on developing breakthrough drugs 
                      for the treatment of disease.<br>
