<p align="JUSTIFY">the Non-defaulting party or non-Affected Party, as applicable, (&quot;<b>X</b>&quot;) shall be entitled, at its option and in its discretion, to set-off any sums or obligations (whether or not arising under this Agreement and whether matured or unmatured) owed or due by the Defaulting Party or Affected Party, as applicable, (&quot;<b>Y</b>&quot;) to X, or an Affiliate of X against any sums or obligations (whether or not arising under this Agreement and whether matured or unmatured) owed or due by X to Y (the "<b>Original Obligations</b>") (in each case such amounts calculated after the deduction of any tax withholding).  For this purpose, X may convert one currency into another. Any such setoff shall reduce the Original Obligations to the extent so set-off.  Any such set off will not create any lien, charge, encumbrance, or security interest in favour of any party hereunder.

For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be unreasonable to withhold consent to a proposed transfer or assignment if the non-transferring or non-assigning party would (a) be required to gross-up its payments to the proposed transferee or assignee or would be required to receive payments from the proposed transferee or assignee net of any withholding or deduction that would not otherwise be required under this Agreement or under applicable law in the absence of the proposed assignment or transfer; (b) if the creditworthiness of the proposed transferee (taking into account credit enhancements) is materially weaker than that of the party proposing the transfer; or (c) the non-transferring party’s collective exposure in respect of all Transactions entered into under this Agreement will, or may, substantially increase  as a result of the proposed transfer (e.g. due to the loss of the benefits of netting).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Enron may, without the consent of Counterparty, (i) assign and/or transfer the whole or any part of its rights or obligations under any Transaction(s) or this Agreement to one or more Affiliates and (ii) assign and/or transfer the whole or any part of its rights or obligations under any Transaction(s) and this Agreement to any person in connection with a financing transaction (including, without limitation, any monetisation, securitisation or sub-participation of Enron’s rights and/or obligations under any or all of the Transactions entered into pursuant to this Agreement).</p>

This Guarantee shall constitute a continuing Guarantee of payment and not of collection <b><i>subject to the following:</p><dir>
<dir>

</b></i><p align="JUSTIFY"> (a)  Guarantor’s liability hereunder shall be and is specifically limited to payments expressly required to be made under the Contract (even if such payments are deemed to be damages) and, except to the extent specifically provided in the Contract, in no event shall Guarantor be subject hereunder to consequential, exemplary, equitable, loss of profits, punitive, tort, or any other damages, costs, or attorney’s fees.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">(b)  The aggregate amount covered by this Guarantee shall not exceed U.S.$ <font color="#ff00ff">[TBA].</p></dir>
</dir>

</font><p align="JUSTIFY">2.  <u>DEMANDS AND NOTICE</u>.

A Payment Demand shall be in writing and shall reasonably and briefly specify in what manner and what amount Enron has failed to pay and an explanation of why such payment is due, with a specific statement that Counterparty is calling upon Guarantor to pay under this Guarantee. A Payment Demand satisfying the foregoing requirements shall be required with respect to Obligations before Guarantor is required to pay such Obligations hereunder and shall be deemed sufficient notice to Guarantor that it must pay the Obligations within five (5) Local Business Days after its receipt of the Payment Demand. A single written Payment Demand shall be effective as to any specific default during the continuance of such default, until Enron or Guarantor has cured such default, and additional written demands concerning such default shall not be required until such default is cured. </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">(b)  no authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this Guarantee; and</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">(c)  this Guarantee, when executed and delivered, will constitute a valid and legally binding agreement of Guarantor, except as the enforceability of this Guarantee may be limited by the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">4.  <u>SETOFFS AND COUNTERCLAIMS</u>.  Without limiting Guarantor’s own defenses and rights hereunder, Guarantor reserves to itself all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses to which Enron or any other affiliate of Guarantor is or may be entitled to arising from or out of the Contract or otherwise, except for defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of Enron.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of Counterparty in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Guarantor consents to the renewal, compromise, extension, acceleration or other changes in the time of payment of or other changes in the terms of the Obligations, or any part thereof or any changes or modifications to the terms of the Contract.</p>
