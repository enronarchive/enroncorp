<p><b>4. Bankruptcy Swap Provisions</b></p>
<ol type="a">
<p align="justify">
<li><b>Payments. </b>Except as provided below, in respect of each Bankruptcy Swap 
entered into hereunder, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the applicable Buyer 
Amount on each Buyer Payment Date commencing on the first Buyer Payment Date to 
occur after the Effective Date and ending on the Transaction Termination Date. 
If the Buyer Payment Date is not a Business Day, the Buyer shall pay the Seller 
the applicable Buyer Amount in respect of such Buyer Payment Date on the 
Business Day immediately following the Buyer Payment Date. 
<p></p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">If on or after the Effective Date and on or before the 
Protection Termination Date a Bankruptcy Event occurs in respect of a Reference 
Entity which is the subject of a Bankruptcy Swap and subsequently a valid 
Bankruptcy Event Notice <b><u>and</b></u> Notice of Publicly Available 
Information is delivered by one party to the other in respect of such Bankruptcy 
Swap, each of which is effective on or before the date falling fourteen calendar 
days after the Protection Termination Date, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer 
the Credit Protection Settlement Amount on the Credit Protection Settlement 
Date. If the Credit Protection Settlement Date is not a Business Day, the Seller 
shall pay the Buyer the applicable Credit Protection Settlement Amount in 
respect of such Credit Protection Settlement Date on the Business Day 
immediately following the Credit Protection Settlement Date.</p>
<p align="justify">All Bankruptcy Event Notices and Notices of Publicly Available 
Information delivered in respect of a Bankruptcy Swap must be delivered on a 
London Business Day. Any such notice that is delivered on or prior to 4 p.m. 
London time on a London Business Day will be effective on such day. A notice 
delivered on or after 4 p.m. London time will be deemed delivered on the next 
following London Business Day. Any notice hereunder may be delivered orally 
(delivered when actually received by the intended recipient) or in writing by 
hand delivery (delivered when actually received by the intended recipient), 
overnight mail service (deemed delivered if delivered upon scheduled weekday 
delivery day), telex (deemed delivered upon receipt of answerback) or 
telefacsimile (deemed delivered upon receipt of evidence, including 
telefacsimile evidence, that the telefacsimile was received). If the notice is 
delivered orally a written confirmation will be executed and delivered 
confirming the substance of that notice within one (1) London Business Day of 
that notice. Failure to provide that written confirmation will not affect the 
effectiveness of that oral notice. If the written confirmation is not received 
within such time, the party obligated to deliver the confirmation will be deemed 
to have satisfied such obligation at the time that the written confirmation of 
the oral notice is received.</p>
<p align="justify">Only one Bankruptcy Event Notice and Notice of Publicly 
Available Information may be delivered in respect of a Bankruptcy Swap and 
either Enron or Counterparty may deliver such notices. Each party hereby agrees 
that the determination of the Determination Agent as to the validity and 
effectiveness of any such notice shall, in the absence of manifest error, be 
final. </p>
<p align="justify">Where a Bankruptcy Event occurs before the Trade Date in 
respect of the Reference Entity that is the subject of a Bankruptcy Swap, such 
Bankruptcy Swap shall be void. Where a Bankruptcy Event occurs on or after the 
Trade Date but before the Effective Date in respect of the Reference Entity 
which is the subject of a Bankruptcy Swap, such Transaction shall automatically 
terminate on the occurrence of such Bankruptcy Event and neither the Buyer nor 
the Seller shall be required to make any payment in respect of such Transaction. 
In both of the foregoing circumstances, if the parties have made payments to 
each other under the Transaction the parties shall account to each other in 
respect of such payments made. </p>
<p align="justify">Each payment will be made in the applicable Contractual 
Currency without deduction, set-off or counterclaim (except as provided herein) 
via wire transfer in immediately available funds prior to 3:00 p.m. London time 
on the relevant payment date. </p><b>
<p align="justify"></p>
<li>Merger of Enron or Counterparty with a Reference Entity. </b>In the event 
that either party and a Reference Entity, consolidate or amalgamate with, or 
merge into, or transfer all or substantially all its assets to, a Reference 
Entity (in the case of a party) or a party (in the case of Reference Entity), or 
a party and a Reference Entity become Affiliates, (each a "<b>Merger 
Event</b>"") all Affected Bankruptcy Swaps shall be deemed automatically 
terminated as of the date of the Merger Event (the "<b>Merger Termination 
Date</b>"), such date to be determined and notified to the parties by the 
Determination Agent. In such circumstances the Buyer shall, in respect of each 
Affected Bankruptcy Swap, pay the Seller the proportion of the Buyer Amount 
accrued up to and including the Merger Termination Date and, if applicable, 
Seller shall account to Buyer in respect of the portion of the Buyer Amount 
received in respect of the period after the Merger Termination Date. For the 
purposes of this provision, "Affected Bankruptcy Swap" means any Bankruptcy Swap 
entered into in respect of the Reference Entity that is the subject of the 
Merger Event.
<p></p></li></ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<p align="justify">Each party agrees that it shall not enter into a Transaction 
where it or any of its Affiliates is the Reference Entity which is the subject 
of the Transaction and any such purported Transaction entered into by the 
parties shall be deemed void and unenforceable.</p>
