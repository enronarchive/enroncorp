<li><b>General Representations and Covenants.</b> Each of Enron and Counterparty 
represents, warrants to, and agrees with, the other (which representation shall 
be deemed repeated each time a Transaction is executed) that (a) <b><i><u>Status 
and Capacity</i></u>:</b> (i) it is duly organised and validly existing under 
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and, if 
relevant under such laws, in good standing; and (ii) it has all requisite 
corporate or governmental or other power and capacity to execute and perform its 
obligations under each Transaction; (b) <b><i><u>Authority</i></u>:</b> (i) the 
execution of each Transaction and the performance of its obligations under each 
Transaction has been duly authorised by all necessary corporate, governmental or 
other organisational action on its part; and (ii) each Transaction is its 
legally valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with 
its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganisation, insolvency, 
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject, as 
to enforceability, to equitable principles of general application (regardless of 
whether an enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law));(c) 
<b><i><u>Eligible Contract Participant</i></u>:</b> (i) it constitutes an 
"eligible contract participant" as such term is defined in Section 1(a)(12) of 
the United States Commodity Exchange Act; and (ii) it is an "accredited 
investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the United 
States Securities and Exchange Commission; (d) <b><i><u>Purpose</i></u>:</b> it 
is entering into each Transaction for bona fide commercial purposes and not in 
any event for the purposes of speculating or gaming; (e) <b><i><u>No 
Reliance</u>:</b> </i>(i) the other party to each Transaction (1) is not acting 
as a fiduciary or financial, investment or commodity trading advisor for it; and 
(2) has not given to it (directly or indirectly through any other person) any 
assurance, guarantee or representation whatsoever as to the merits (either 
legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) of each Transaction, 
or the expected performance or result of each Transaction; and (ii) in 
connection with the negotiation and execution of each Transaction (1) it is 
acting as a principal (and not as an agent or in any other capacity, fiduciary 
or otherwise); (2) it is not relying upon any advice, counsel or representations 
(whether written or oral) of the other party other than the representations 
expressly set forth in these GTCs, incorporated herein or set out on the 
Website; (3) it has made and will make its own assessment and decisions 
regarding the entering into each Transaction based upon its own judgment and 
upon the advice from such professional advisors as it has deemed, or will deem, 
necessary to consult; (4) all of its decisions regarding each Transaction have 
been the result of arm’s length negotiations between the parties; and (5) it has 
a full understanding of all the terms, conditions and risks (economic and 
otherwise) of each Transaction, and it is capable of assuming and willing to 
assume (financially, legally and otherwise) those risks; (f) 
<b><i><u>Transactions:</i></u> </b>in connection with each Transaction, (i) 
neither the other party nor any of the other party’s Affiliates makes any 
representation whatsoever with respect to the Reference Entity on which it is 
relying or entitled to rely; (ii) it is obligated to perform in accordance with 
these GTCs irrespective of the existence or amount of the other party’s credit 
exposure to the Reference Entity, and the other party need not suffer any loss 
or provide evidence of any loss as a result of the occurrence of a Bankruptcy 
Event or Credit Event; (iii) each Transaction does not create on the part of 
either party either a direct or an indirect obligation of the Reference Entity; 
and (iv) unless it is otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation or 
agreement, a party receiving any information from the other party with respect 
to each Transaction shall not become the subject of any obligation of 
confidentiality in respect of that information and the transferor of that 
information shall indemnify and hold harmless the transferee for any loss, 
liability, claim damage and expenses whatsoever incurred by the transferee 
arising out of the breach of law or understanding or agreement with respect to 
the confidentiality of the information to which the transferor may be a party.

<p align="justify">
<li>ENRON AND COUNTERPARTY MAY TRADE ACTIVELY WITH MANY OF THE REFERENCE

WITH SUCH ENTITIES. AS A RESULT OF THESE TRADING ACTIVITIES AND RELATIONSHIPS, 
ENRON AND COUNTERPARTY MAY HAVE INTERESTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ENTITIES THAT ARE 
ADVERSE TO THE INTERESTS OF THE OTHER PARTY IN CREDIT PRODUCT TRANSACTIONS. FOR 
EXAMPLE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ENRON OR COUNTERPARTY WILL, BY EXERCISING ITS 
RIGHTS UNDER ITS AGREEMENTS WITH A REFERENCE ENTITY, AN AFFILIATE OF A REFERENCE 
ENTITY, OR A PERSON WITH OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO A REFERENCE ENTITY, TAKE 
ACTIONS THAT RESULT IN THE OCCURRENCE OF A BANKRUPTCY EVENT OR CREDIT EVENT WITH

OCCURRENCE OF SUCH BANKRUPTCY EVENT OR CREDIT EVENT MAY TRIGGER SUCH PARTY’S

CONTINUE TO CONDUCT ITS TRADING ACTIVITIES AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH REFERENCE 
ENTITIES IN THE SAME MANNER AS SUCH ACTIVITIES AND RELATIONSHIPS WOULD BE 
CONDUCTED NOTWITHSTANDING THESE GTCs OR ANY TRANSACTION HEREUNDER AND WILL ACT 
IN ITS OWN BEST INTERESTS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH RELATIONSHIPS. IN DOING SO, 
ENRON AND COUNTERPARTY MAY OR MAY NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS OF THE 
OTHER PARTY IN TRANSACTIONS AND ENRON AND COUNTERPARTY’S PARTICIPATION IN

SUCH ENTITIES. ENRON AND COUNTERPARTY MAY NOT PROVIDE ANY SUCH INFORMATION TO 
THE OTHER PARTY. ENRON AND COUNTERPARTY MAY, HOWEVER, USE SUCH INFORMATION IN 
CONNECTION WITH ITS OWN ACTIVITIES REGARDING REFERENCE ENTITIES. ANY SUCH USE BY 
ENRON AND COUNTERPARTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OTHER PARTY. IN ADDITION, 
ENRON MAY, BUT WILL NOT BE OBLIGED TO, TAKE SUCH INFORMATION INTO ACCOUNT IN 
DETERMINING THE PRICE OF CREDIT PRODUCTS.

not executed a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement, Enron and Counterparty agree to use

form of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) (the 
"<b>ISDA Form</b>"), with such modifications as Enron and Counterparty may in 
good faith agree, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the "<b>Master
