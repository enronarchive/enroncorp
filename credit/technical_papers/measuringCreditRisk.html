		<h3>Measuring Credit Risk on Derivative Exposures</h3>
		<h4>Ben Parson - Enron Europe Research Group</h4>
	</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Credit risk is dependent upon many variables, making its pricing a complex 
issue. Consider a plain vanilla gas swap with counterparty XYZ: Our primary 
exposure is to the risk of XYZ going bankrupt, resulting in loss of the current 
mark-to-market (MTM) value, less any recovery value. This exposure is dynamic, 
subject to underlying price curve movements and the amount we recover upon 
bankruptcy . Any increases in the MTM value will increase our credit exposure, 
whereas increases in our expected recovery rate will reduce our exposure. This 
analysis describes the steps we would take to quantify these risks, in order to 
accurately model the credit risk in the deal. The three steps are 1) to 
calculate approximate probabilities of bankruptcy for counterparty XYZ; 2) 
estimate the future MTM value lost upon bankruptcy; and 3) assign a recovery 
value.</p>
<p><b>1. BANKRUPTCY RISK</b></p>
<p>Many varied methods facilitate the estimation of bankruptcy probabilities. 
The bankruptcy swap is the only traded instrument which enables direct 
computation of implied rates, however this market is still in its infancy. More 
traditional methods include using bond and credit derivative prices; the 
option-theoretic models of Merton and KMV; statistical estimation using 
financial ratios; and historical analysis.</p>
<p><b>1.1 BANKRUPTCY SWAP IMPLIED PROBABILITIES</b></p>
<p>
<p>The bankruptcy swap is a digital credit derivative, whereby the payoff occurs 
upon the bankruptcy of the reference entity, and the payoff equals the full 
notional value of the contract. The simplicity of the structure enables the 
direct computation of a bankruptcy probability curve, using a bootstrapping 
algorithm based upon observed market prices at different tenors.</p>
<p><b>1.2 CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP IMPLIED PROBABILITIES</b></p>
<p>
<p>Credit default swaps are currently more liquid instruments than bankruptcy 
swaps, so the breadth of credit information available in this market is greater. 
However, the credit event underlying these contracts is typically default on an 
underlying bond, and the payoff is par less recovery following default. This 
requires two further assumptions to extract bankruptcy probabilities. First the 
recovery rate on the underlying bond must be estimated. Secondly the discount to 
transform bond default probabilities into bankruptcy probabilities must be 
estimated. This measure, called the “Event Discount”, can be estimated from the 
ratio between historical default and bankruptcy rates.</p>
<p><b>1.3 BOND IMPLIED PROBABILITIES</b></p>
<p>
<p>Using bonds we can derive bond default probabilities. The spread between the 
yields on risky corporate and risk-free bonds reflects the risk that the 
corporate will fail to repay the coupons and principal. However pricing 
information on corporate bonds is often scarce, so generic “Fair Market” yield 
curves for the credit rating and industry of the counterparty can be used as a 
proxy. </p>
<p><sup>1</sup>The real risk on the contract is failure-to-pay rather than 
bankruptcy. However failure-to-pay is a contract-specific event, whereas 
bankruptcy occurs in the public domain. Also failure-to-pay often results in 
bankruptcy so the two events are closely tied. For these reasons we focus on 
bankruptcy as our credit event.</p>
<p>Issuer-specific yield curves can be constructed using exponential splines 
(Vasicek and Fong), or affine models such as Hull-White or Cox-Ingersoll-Ross. 
These work well when a wide spectrum of liquid bonds from consistent pricing 
sources is available. When the number of bonds for a particular issuer is small 
however, more ad hoc techniques must be employed. One useful technique is to 
define a universe of curves “parallel” to the Fair Market curves, then find the 
curve which best prices the input bonds.</p>
<p>Given the risky yield curve, we must now define where the risk-free curve 
lies in order to generate credit spreads. Traditionally the government curve has 
been used. However, in recent months, this has become problematic, especially in 
the UK and US. Budget surpluses have resulted in the buy-back of government 
debt, inverting the yield curve and creating a scarcity premium at long 
maturities. Many analysts and traders now consider the LIBOR or swap curve to be 
a closer proxy to the true risk-free rate. This is, however, still not ideal as 
many high-rated credits trade below the swap curve, creating negative 
probabilities. Agency rates (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac) and AAA credits (GE) are 
also vying for the status of the global benchmark risk-free curve, but neither 
has gained widespread acceptance.</p>
<p>Once we have the credit spreads, we can derive bond-default probabilities 
using the following formula; where r is the risky forward interest rate, rf the 
risk-free forward interest rate, R the risky bond’s recovery rate upon default, 
and p the probability of default.</p>
<!--<div align="center"><br><img alt="" border="0" height="58" src="/web/20010429014133im_/http://www.enroncredit.com/technical_Papers/images/formula01.gif" width="196"><br></div>-->
<p>This formula says that the default-risk adjusted return on the risky bond 
equals the return on the risk-free bond, which assumes risk-neutrality of 
investors. The probability of default is backed out as:</p>
<!--<div align="center"><br><img alt="" border="0" height="61" src="/web/20010429014133im_/http://www.enroncredit.com/technical_Papers/images/formula02.gif" width="176"><br></div>-->
<p>This method is described further in Buy, Kaminski, Krishnarao, and 
Shanbhogue. Other methods for estimating bankruptcy probabilities from credit 
spreads include adjusting the actual cashflows from the bonds for default risk 
(Fons), or by using no-arbitrage arguments about the price of the bond rather 
than the interest rates embedded within it (Jarrow and Turnbull).</p>
<p>Again we have the issues described earlier regarding the estimation of the 
recovery rate and event discount parameters, in order to convert the estimated 
default probability into a bankruptcy probability.</p>
<p><b>1.4 MERTON OPTION-THEORETIC APPROACH</b></p>
<p>
<p>This approach, pioneered by Black, Scholes and Merton, views the equity of a 
firm as a call option on the assets of the firm, where the exercise price and 
maturity correspond to the face value and maturity of the outstanding debt. 
Equivalently, using put-call parity, the debt-holders of the firm can be 
considered to have sold a put option based on the firm’s assets to the equity 
holders. The put option will be exercised whenever the asset value of the firm 
falls below the debt level. The probability of default of the firm then equals 
the probability that the put option is exercised.</p>
<p>Using the book value of debt and the market value of equity, along with an 
estimate of equity volatility, it is then possible to reverse engineer the 
implied asset value and volatility. An assumption of normality for asset returns 
then allows the direct computation of the probability of default as the 
probability of assets dropping below the debt level at some point before the 
debt’s maturity.
<p>
<p>KMV (Vasicek, Crosbie) differ from the traditional Merton approach in the 
final distributional assumption. Rather than assume normality, they define the 
“distance-to-default” as the distance between asset and debt levels, scaled for 
asset volatility, then use a database of historic distances-to-default and 
subsequent defaults to estimate the probability. This overcomes one of the major 
flaws in the Merton approach – that short-term probabilities are too small – but 
leaves the estimated probability as a historic measure, which is unsuitable for 
mark-to-market trading. However the resulting expected default frequencies (EDF) 
do provide excellent leading indicators of financial distress as relayed through 
the equity markets.</p>
<p><b>1.5 STATISTICAL MODELS</b></p>
<p>
<p>Statistical techniques based on financial ratios and accounting data are 
either simplistic, or the most general framework available for credit pricing, 
depending on your point of view. Often criticised for lacking any overriding 
theory, they compensate for this by being the most flexible and the most 
appropriate for estimating default risk on small firms without any traded debt. 
By replicating the credit analyst or traders’ thinking when trying to rate or 
price a company, the methodology provides this closest fit to reality.</p>
<p>The Altman Z-score model is the most famous. Using multivariate discriminant 
analysis based upon variables such as in Table 1, the model classifies firms 
into one of two groups – bankrupt or non-bankrupt. Other models based on 
logistic and linear regression techniques can also be used for classifying 
companies into ratings and for direct estimation of their bankruptcy risk.</p>

<p><b>Table 1. Example Financial Ratios</b> </p></div>
<p>A new approach gaining widespread popularity for both rating and pricing 
companies is based on neural networks. Using the same set of financial ratios, 
alongside equity based indicators such as distance-to-default and equity 
volatility, neural networks allow the identification of non-linear relationships 
between the input and output variables. Success in this area can be seen in the 
proliferation of software products currently hitting the market (IQ Financial, 
Moody’s Public Firm Model) and in recent academic interest (Albanis, Coats and 
Fant).</p>
<p><b>1.6 HISTORICAL ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p>
<p>Using data collected by ratings agencies (Moody’s, Standard and Poors), 
direct estimation of historical default and bankruptcy rates is possible. 
Scarcity of data does not permit detailed conclusions to be made, beyond rates 
estimated per rating per year. The best application for the data is to determine 
the risk premium observed in the credit markets, by comparing rates implied from 
bonds or credit derivatives and historical rates. Using historical rates for 
direct credit risk analysis in a mark-to-market environment is not suitable as 
credit costs calculated internally will never match the current market 
cost-of-credit, and thus hedging of credit exposure will be uneconomic.</p>
<p><b>1.7 SIMULATING DEFAULTS</b></p>
<p>
<p>We can now assume that bankruptcy rates calculated from any of the above 
methods are either static or stochastic. A widely used model for stochastic 
bankruptcy rates is taken from the literature on birth-death processes and 
survival times. We model the time of bankruptcy of XYZ as the arrival rate of a 
Poisson process with intensity h, which is called a hazard rate. By positing a 
stochastic process for h(t), such as Cox-Ingersoll-Ross or Geometric Brownian 
Motion (GBM), we introduce volatility into our bankruptcy rates. From each 
month’s bankruptcy rate realisation, simulating a bankruptcy time simply 
involves drawing a random number from [0,1] and comparing it with the rate. For 
example, if the bankruptcy rate realisations for years 1 and 2 were 0.1 and 
0.05, and the random number draw turned out as 0.12, then bankruptcy would be 
simulated in year 2 since 0.10 &lt; 0.12 &lt; 0.10+0.05.</p>
<p><b>2. MTM VALUATION AT BANKRUPTCY</b></p>
<p>
<p>Using either static or stochastic bankruptcy rates we build a distribution of 
bankruptcy times from a Monte Carlo simulation. In most simulations counterparty 
XYZ remains solvent, but whenever it does go bankrupt, the next step is to 
arrive at a MTM value for the deal at the time of bankruptcy. This firstly 
relies upon traditional price curve simulation for example using GBM, 
Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) or trend-reversion processes; then revaluation of the 
deal, which can use an approximation or the full valuation model. The key aspect 
to remember is that credit risk is asymmetric – we will not gain from default on 
any of our out-of-the-money contracts. So the credit exposure equals the maximum 
of the MTM value and zero, as shown in the following graph:</p>
<!--<div align="center"><br><img alt="" border="0" height="164" src="/web/20010429014133im_/http://www.enroncredit.com/technical_Papers/images/chart.gif" width="370"><br><br></div>-->
<div align="center"><b>Graph 1: Credit Exposure against Underlying Swap 
Price</b></div>
<p>The option-like payoff structure displays two important credit phenomena. 
At-the-money swap contracts will have positive credit risk; and credit risk will 
be positively correlated to underlying price volatility. These often-overlooked 
facts are critical for thorough credit risk analysis.</p>
<p><b>3. RECOVERY UPON BANKRUPTCY</b></p>
<p>
<p>Now two steps of the modelling are complete – bankruptcy and market risk. The 
final and most subjective pieces of the puzzle are the recovery rate embedded 
within the bonds underpinning the implied methods above, and the specific 
contract recovery rate following bankruptcy. Historical analysis can allow the 
estimation of average recovery rates for different debt seniorities and 
industries, but again the data is scarce and often unreliable due to regime 
shifts. However until a liquid market develops which allows the implication of 
recovery rates from market prices, historical estimates are the best we have, 
alongside our own judgement.</p>
<p><b>4. COMPLETING THE PICTURE</b></p>
<p>
<p>Applying the recovery rate to the credit exposure gives the loss following 
bankruptcy. A full Monte Carlo simulation of bankruptcy and price curves allows 
us to build a distribution of credit losses. The resultant distribution will be 
heavily skewed with a concentration at zero (representing no bankruptcy or loss) 
and a long thin tail. The mean of the distribution then represents the “Expected 
Loss” which is taken as the credit reserve on the deal. The 95th or 99th 
percentile loss is the Credit VaR. The latter measure is more important from a 
portfolio viewpoint, and can be used as a guideline for insurance purposes 
against multiple bankruptcies during periods of extreme market stress.</p>
<p>These tools enable the risk manager to model the credit risk arising from 
certain deals and combinations of deals. However they must always be aware of 
the saying “garbage in, garbage out” when assessing the results. The numerical 
inputs to these models are often fairly approximate and subjective, and rarely 
model exactly the risk on the deal. The risk manager must be aware of these 
problems, before they can gain any benefit from the results.</p>
