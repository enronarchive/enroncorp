<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p><hr align="LEFT" size="1">What is the Enron Credit RiskSheet?</p></font></b>

<p>With the Enron Credit RiskSheet, you can have the portfolio(s) you build on <a href="/credit/">www.enroncredit.com</a> e-mailed to you in the form of an Excel spreadsheet on a daily or weekly basis.</p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>What data will my RiskSheet contain?</p>
</b></font>
<p>Using our web site at <a href="/credit/">www.enroncredit.com</a> you will be able to create your own portfolios, containing reference entities specifically of interest to you. </p>

<p>After you set up your portfolio, you can define the data you wish to receive directly on our website.  The RiskSheet configuration page can be accessed through the Portfolio section of our site, under &quot;Customize Portfolio&quot; step 3. </p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I easily change the reference entities in my portfolios?</p>
</b></font>
<p>Because the RiskSheet is dispatched based on portfolios that you maintain, you can change the reference entities at any time.  Simply update company names within the &quot;Customize Portfolio&quot; section of the website, and the changes will be reflected in your next regularly scheduled delivery.  </p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>How often will I receive my Enron Credit RiskSheet?</p>
</b></font>
<p>You can configure the system to deliver your data daily or weekly.  The delivery frequency can be changed on the RiskSheet configuration page, which can be found in the Portfolio section under &quot;Customize Portfolio.&quot;</p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>How will I take delivery of the Enron Credit RiskSheet?</p>
</b></font>
<p>The RiskSheet will be formatted as an Excel spreadsheet and will be sent as an e-mail attachment to the address listed on your Enron Credit membership account.  If you would like to change the e-mail address where your RiskSheet is sent, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:credit-desk@enroncorp.com">credit-desk@enron.com</a> and we will update your account details.  You can also change your account details directly on our website.  </p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>I do not have Microsoft Excel.  Can I still subscribe to the RiskSheet?</p>
</b></font>
<p>The Risk Sheet will be formatted as a Microsoft Excel 5.0 spreadsheet.  If your software package is compatible with Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or higher, you should be able to take delivery of the RiskSheet.  If your software is <i>not</i> compatible with Excel 5.0, please contact Enron Credit and we will try to find an appropriate solution.  </p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Does the RiskSheet have any size limitations?</p>
</b></font>
<p>Since the Enron Credit RiskSheet is delivered as an e-mail attachment, the maximum number of portfolios we can support is five.  Each portfolio can contain a maximum of 250 reference entities.</p>
