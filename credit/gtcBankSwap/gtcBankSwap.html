  <li>Payments. </b>Except as provided below, in respect of 
  each Bankruptcy Swap entered into hereunder, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller 
  the applicable Buyer Amount on each Buyer Payment Date commencing on the first 
  Buyer Payment Date to occur after the Effective Date and ending on the 
  Transaction Termination Date. If the Buyer Payment Date is not a Business Day, 
  the Buyer shall pay the Seller the applicable Buyer Amount in respect of such 
  Buyer Payment Date on the Business Day immediately following the Buyer Payment 
  Date. 
  <p></p>
  <p align="justify"></p>
  <p align="justify">If on or after the Effective Date and on 
  or before the Protection Termination Date a Bankruptcy Event occurs in respect 
  of a Reference Entity which is the subject of a Bankruptcy Swap and 
  subsequently a valid Bankruptcy Event Notice <b><u>and</b></u> Notice of Publicly Available Information is 
  delivered by one party to the other in respect of such Bankruptcy Swap, each 
  of which is effective on or before the date falling fourteen calendar days 
  after the Protection Termination Date, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the 
  Credit Protection Settlement Amount on the Credit Protection Settlement Date. 
  If the Credit Protection Settlement Date is not a Business Day, the Seller 
  shall pay the Buyer the applicable Credit Protection Settlement Amount in 
  respect of such Credit Protection Settlement Date on the Business Day 
  immediately following the Credit Protection Settlement Date.</p>
  <p align="justify">All Bankruptcy Event Notices and Notices 
  of Publicly Available Information delivered in respect of a Bankruptcy Swap 
  must be delivered on a London Business Day. Any such notice that is delivered 
  on or prior to 4 p.m. London time on a London Business Day will be effective 
  on such day. A notice delivered on or after 4 p.m. London time will be deemed 
  delivered on the next following London Business Day. Any notice hereunder may 
  be delivered orally (delivered when actually received by the intended 
  recipient) or in writing by hand delivery (delivered when actually received by 
  the intended recipient), overnight mail service (deemed delivered if delivered 
  upon scheduled weekday delivery day), telex (deemed delivered upon receipt of 
  answerback) or telefacsimile (deemed delivered upon receipt of evidence, 
  including telefacsimile evidence, that the telefacsimile was received). If the 
  notice is delivered orally a written confirmation will be executed and 
  delivered confirming the substance of that notice within one (1) London 
  Business Day of that notice. Failure to provide that written confirmation will 
  not affect the effectiveness of that oral notice. If the written confirmation 
  is not received within such time, the party obligated to deliver the 
  confirmation will be deemed to have satisfied such obligation at the time that 
  the written confirmation of the oral notice is received.</p>
  <p align="justify">Only one Bankruptcy Event Notice and 
  Notice of Publicly Available Information may be delivered in respect of a 
  Bankruptcy Swap and either Enron or Counterparty may deliver such notices.

  manifest error, be final. </p>

  the Trade Date in respect of the Reference Entity that is the subject of a 
  Bankruptcy Swap, such Bankruptcy Swap shall be void. Where a Bankruptcy Event 
  occurs on or after the Trade Date but before the Effective Date in respect of 
  the Reference Entity which is the subject of a Bankruptcy Swap, such 
  Transaction shall automatically terminate on the occurrence of such Bankruptcy 
  Event and neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall be required to make any 
  payment in respect of such Transaction. In both of the foregoing 
  circumstances, if the parties have made payments to each other under the 
  Transaction the parties shall account to each other in respect of such 
  payments made. </p>
  <p align="justify">Each payment will be made in the

  <li>Merger of Enron or Counterparty with a Reference

  assets to, a Reference Entity (in the case of a party) or a party (in the case 
  of Reference Entity), or a party and a Reference Entity become Affiliates, 
  (each a &quot;<b>Merger Event</b>&quot;&quot;) all Affected Bankruptcy 
  Swaps shall be deemed automatically terminated as of the date of the Merger 
  Event (the &quot;<b>Merger Termination Date</b>&quot;), such date to 
  be determined and notified to the parties by the Determination Agent. In such 
  circumstances the Buyer shall, in respect of each Affected Bankruptcy Swap, 
  pay the Seller the proportion of the Buyer Amount accrued up to and including 
  the Merger Termination Date and, if applicable, Seller shall account to Buyer 
  in respect of the portion of the Buyer Amount received in respect of the 
  period after the Merger Termination Date. For the purposes of this provision, 
  &quot;Affected Bankruptcy Swap&quot; means any Bankruptcy Swap entered into in respect 
  of the Reference Entity that is the subject of the Merger Event.

Termination Date as a result of an Event of Default or Termination Event under 
Section 5(b)(iv) or Section 5(b)(v) of this Agreement and determination of the 
amount payable in accordance with Section 6(e) of this Agreement, in addition to 
and not in limitation of any other right or remedy (including any right to 
setoff, counterclaim, or otherwise withhold payment) under applicable law: </p>

<p align="justify">the Non-defaulting party or non-Affected 
Party, as applicable, (&quot;<b>X</b>&quot;) shall be entitled, at its 
option and in its discretion, to set-off any sums or obligations (whether or not 
arising under this Agreement and whether matured or unmatured) owed or due by 
the Defaulting Party or Affected Party, as applicable, (&quot;<b>Y</b>&quot;) to X, or an Affiliate of X against any sums or 
obligations (whether or not arising under this Agreement and whether matured or 
unmatured) owed or due by X to Y (the &quot;<b>Original 
Obligations</b>&quot;) (in each case such amounts calculated after the deduction of 
any tax withholding). For this purpose, X may convert one currency into another. 
Any such setoff shall reduce the Original Obligations to the extent so set-off. 
Any such set off will not create any lien, charge, encumbrance, or security 
interest in favour of any party hereunder. This Section shall be without 
prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien 
or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by 
operation of law, contract or otherwise). </p></dir></dir><b><i>
<p align="justify">(h) Transfers.</b></i> This Agreement and 
each Transaction entered into hereunder shall be binding upon and inure for the 
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 
Subject to the following provisions of this Section, neither party shall have 
the power to assign or otherwise transfer (whether by security or otherwise) all 
or any of its rights, interest or obligations under this Agreement or any 
Transaction without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and any purported assignment or 
transfer in violation of this provision shall be void and of no force and 
effect. For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be unreasonable to withhold 
consent to a proposed transfer or assignment if the non-transferring or 
non-assigning party would (a) be required to gross-up its payments to the 
proposed transferee or assignee or would be required to receive payments from 
the proposed transferee or assignee net of any withholding or deduction that 
would not otherwise be required under this Agreement or under applicable law in 
the absence of the proposed assignment or transfer; (b) if the creditworthiness 
of the proposed transferee (taking into account credit enhancements) is 
materially weaker than that of the party proposing the transfer; or (c) the 
non-transferring party&#146;s collective exposure in respect of all Transactions 
entered into under this Agreement will, or may, substantially increase as a 
result of the proposed transfer (e.g. due to the loss of the benefits of 
netting).</p>
<p align="justify">Enron may, without the consent of 
Counterparty, (i) assign and/or transfer the whole or any part of its rights or 
obligations under any Transaction(s) or this Agreement to one or more Affiliates 
and (ii) assign and/or transfer the whole or any part of its rights or 
obligations under any Transaction(s) and this Agreement to any person in 
connection with a financing transaction (including, without limitation, any 
monetisation, securitisation or sub-participation of Enron&#146;s rights and/or 
obligations under any or all of the Transactions entered into pursuant to this

<p align="justify">WHEREAS, Counterparty and <b>[<font color="#ff00ff">INSERT NAME OF ENRON ENTITY</font>]</b> (&quot;<b>Enron</b>&quot;), a subsidiary of 
Guarantor, are contemplating entering and/or have entered into one or more swap, 
option or other financially-settled derivative transactions (each a &quot;<b>Transaction</b>&quot;), which shall pursuant to their respective 
terms be subject to a deemed agreement in the form of the 1992 ISDA Master 
Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) (the &quot;<b>Deemed 
Agreement</b>&quot;);</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">WHEREAS, Counterparty and Enron have agreed 
to use all reasonable endeavors promptly to negotiate, execute and deliver an 
agreement in the form of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (Mulitcurrency - Cross 
Border), with such modifications as Counterparty and Enron will in good faith 
agree (the &quot;<b>Agreement</b>&quot;);</p>

<p align="justify">WHEREAS, upon the execution of the 
Agreement by Counterparty and Enron such Agreement shall amend and supersede the 
Deemed Agreement and all Confirmations shall, in accordance with their 
respective terms, supplement, form a part of, and be subject to the Agreement; 
and</p>
<p align="justify">NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of 
Counterparty entering into the Transactions, Guarantor hereby covenants and 
agrees as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">1. <u>GUARANTEE</u>. 
Subject to the provisions hereof, Guarantor hereby irrevocably and 
unconditionally guarantee&#146;s the timely payment when due of the obligations of 
Enron (the &quot;<b>Obligations</b>&quot;) to Counterparty under the 
Deemed Agreement or Agreement, as applicable, (the &quot;<b>Contract</b>&quot;). This Guarantee shall constitute a continuing 
Guarantee of payment and not of collection <b><i>subject to the following:</p>
<dir>
<dir></b></i>
<p align="justify">(a) Guarantor&#146;s liability hereunder shall 
be and is specifically limited to payments expressly required to be made under 
the Contract (even if such payments are deemed to be damages) and, except to the 
extent specifically provided in the Contract, in no event shall Guarantor be 
subject hereunder to consequential, exemplary, equitable, loss of profits, 
punitive, tort, or any other damages, costs, or attorney&#146;s fees.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The aggregate amount covered by this 
Guarantee shall not exceed U.S.$ <font color="#ff00ff">[TBA].</p></dir></dir></font>
<p align="justify">2. <u>DEMANDS AND 
NOTICE</u>. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of 
Default,<font color="#ff0000"> </font>if Enron fails or refuses to pay any Obligations and 
Counterparty has elected to exercise its rights under this Guarantee, 
Counterparty shall make a demand upon Guarantor (hereinafter referred to as a 
&quot;<b>Payment Demand</b>&quot;). A Payment Demand shall be in 
writing and shall reasonably and briefly specify in what manner and what amount 
Enron has failed to pay and an explanation of why such payment is due, with a 
specific statement that Counterparty is calling upon Guarantor to pay under this 
Guarantee. A Payment Demand satisfying the foregoing requirements shall be 
required with respect to Obligations before Guarantor is required to pay such 
Obligations hereunder and shall be deemed sufficient notice to Guarantor that it 
must pay the Obligations within five (5) Local Business Days after its receipt 
of the Payment Demand. A single written Payment Demand shall be effective as to 
any specific default during the continuance of such default, until Enron or 
Guarantor has cured such default, and additional written demands concerning such 
default shall not be required until such default is cured. </p>
<p align="justify">3. <u>REPRESENTATIONS 
AND WARRANTIES</u>. Guarantor represents and warrants that:</p>
<p align="justify">(a) it is a corporation duly organized and 
validly existing under the laws of the State of Oregon and has the corporate 
power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions 
of the Guarantee; </p>
<p align="justify">(b) no authorization, approval, consent or 
order of, or registration or filing with, any court or other governmental body 
having jurisdiction over Guarantor is required on the part of Guarantor for the 
execution and delivery of this Guarantee; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) this Guarantee, when executed and 
delivered, will constitute a valid and legally binding agreement of Guarantor, 
except as the enforceability of this Guarantee may be limited by the effect of 
any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar 
laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
