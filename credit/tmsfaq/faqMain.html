      The ECC (Enron Cost of Credit) is a simple numeric measure of the cost 
      of extending trade credit to a company based on Enron Credit's 
      proprietary model. It is designed to make it easy to compare such 
      credit-related cost of doing business with different companies - a 
      company with an ECC of 5% would be &quot;cheaper&quot; to transact with than one 
      with an ECC of 5.4%. 
    </p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		
<p>
      In addition to making comparisons simple, the ECC is also meaningful. It 
      approximates to the estimated risk of the company becoming bankrupt in 
      the course of a year, multiplied by the amount you might expect to lose 
      after such bankruptcy. For example, if a company has a 1% chance of 
      going bankrupt and you expect to lose 60% of your money in the case of 
      its bankruptcy, the ECC would be 0.6% (or 60 basis points). This company 
      is more expensive to do business with than a company with a 2% chance of 
      being declared bankrupt, but from which you would expect to recover 90% 
      of your money - an ECC of 0.2% (or 20 basis points).

      To evaluate how much credit exposure is costing you in a single 
      transaction, look at the value of your exposure and how long you will 
      have this exposure. Look up the ECC on Enron Credit and multiply this by 
      your exposure to obtain the &quot;cost&quot; of protecting yourself against 
      bankruptcy of the counterparty. Remember, the ECC gives an annual cost - 
      so if you have a long-term exposure you will need to multiply this cost 
      by the number of years you are holding the credit risk.
    </p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		
<p>
      By comparing this credit cost of different transactions, you can 
      identify the most profitable transactions to enter into, taking account 
      of credit risk. If you have two possible transactions both of which 
      yield the same profit (before consideration of credit risk), you would 
      choose to transact with the company with the lower value of ECC as the 
      profit from this transaction is less risky.

      The primary tool in the reduction of credit exposure is to purchase some 
      form of credit protection. It is important that the protection is well 
      matched to the nature of the exposure - in terms of value, term and 
      triggering event. For the typical credit risk in commercial contracts 
      between corporates, the Digital Bankruptcy Swap product offered by Enron 
      Credit can be a useful tool to reduce credit exposure.
    </p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		
<p>
      A second method is to diversify your credit exposure. By selling 
      protection on companies that are unrelated to your credit portfolio you 
      can gain a source of income to cover the purchase of protection and 
      additionally can reduce the overall risk in your portfolio. For more 
      information on the benefits of diversification, please call us on  0800

      Recovery is the proportion of the debt that you are owed which you are

<p>
      A Digital Bankruptcy Swap is a method for transferring financial risk 
      incurred due to a counterparty bankruptcy from one company to another. 
      One company (the &quot;protection seller&quot;) will promise to pay a certain 
      fixed amount (the &quot;notional&quot;) to another (the &quot;protection buyer&quot;) if a 
      third company (the &quot;reference credit&quot;) files for bankruptcy. For 
      offering this protection, the seller will charge a fee - this is usually 
      specified as a percentage of the notional amount to be paid quarterly. 
      This is normally defined in basis points, where 100 basis points = 1%.
    </p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		
<p>
      For example, Enron Credit may sell you $1 million of protection in the 
      event that XYZ Corp files for bankruptcy. For this protection, Enron 
      Credit might charge 2% p.a. of the notional, i.e. $20,000. In return, if 
      XYZ Corp is declared bankrupt, Enron Credit will pay you $1 million.
    </p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		
<p>
      Unlike an insurance contract, payment is made automatically when the 
      bankruptcy filing has been confirmed - there is no requirement to prove 
      (or mitigate) any loss.

<li><p>
      how much would you lose? This is influenced both by your exposure, and 
      how much you would expect to recover in the case that your counterparty 
      became bankrupt.
    </p></li>
				
<li><p>
      the term for which you require protection.

      You would purchase a Digital Bankruptcy Swap to mitigate the risk that 
      your customers do not pay on commercial contracts as a result of their 
      bankruptcy.
    </p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		
<p>
      When looking at credit protection on a counterparty, you should assess 
      your profit at risk under the relevant commercial contract(s) and then 
      assess the likely recovery you would make if the counterparty failed to 
      make payment and was declared bankrupt.
    </p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		
<p>
      For example, if you have US$10m profit at risk and estimate that you 
      would recover 50% of this if the counterparty failed, then you have an 
      estimated credit exposure of US$5m - so you would be looking to buy a 
      Digital Bankruptcy Swap with a &quot;notional&quot; value of US$5m from Enron 
      Credit.
    </p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		
<p>
      You may also want to use Digital Bankruptcy Swaps to diversify your 
      credit exposure. Many companies find themselves with their credit risks 
      concentrated in a few industries or geographic regions - in this 
      situation, one event can adversely affect many contracts - either 
      through bankruptcies or an increase in the costs of credit protection. 
      You can use the portfolios in Enron Credit and the ECC-measure of credit 
      risk by industry or geography to see how exposed your credit portfolio 
      is today.
    </p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		
<p>As well as buying bankruptcy (or other credit ) protection on the relevant companies you could also diversify your credit exposure by selling protection on unrelated companies. In effect, you can "swap" exposure to a sector in which you have excess exposure for one in which you still have head-room in your credit limits.</p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		
<p>Selling protection allows you to make more efficient use of your credit limits and provides a source of income to offset the costs of purchasing credit protection. This new income should not be adversely affected by events affecting your existing credit risk portfolio (and vice versa).</p>

<p>The Enron Credit Digital Bankruptcy Swap has a number of clear advantages over other types of credit protection.</p>
			

		

		
		<p></p>
	
		

		

		
<ul>
				
<li><p>
      The trigger event of bankruptcy is more closely related to the true 
      credit risk in many commercial contracts than bond default (bond default 
      is a common payment trigger under a Credit Default Swap). This means 
      that Enron Credit offers more competitive pricing.
    </p></li>
				
<li><p>
      Payout is automatic on bankruptcy being confirmed - there is no need to 
      prove any loss or to go through a lengthy and costly claims process as 
      can be required with insurance. You know exactly what you will receive 
      from the swap in the event of bankruptcy. You will be paid the full 
      &quot;notional&quot; value of the swap.
    </p></li>
				
<li><p>Enron Credit offers prices and other useful credit risk information on-line.</p></li>
				
<li><p>Our Digital Bankruptcy Swap uses standardized documentation - reducing your transaction costs.</p></li>
				
<li><p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Enron Credit provides an environment in which you can easily adjust your 
      level of protection at any time or re-sell any excess protection.

      Would we still get paid if my company was responsible for filing the

      Regardless of who petitions for bankruptcy (you or even the Reference 
      Entity itself), if the bankruptcy petition is not dismissed, withdrawn 
      or stayed within 30 days of its presentation (or 60 days in the case of 
      North American Reference Entities), and if the other conditions for 
      settlement are satisfied, the protection amount becomes payable to you 
      by the protection seller &#8211; Enron Credit in this example. Full details 
      can be found in the Bankruptcy Swap General Terms &amp; Conditions on the

      The mechanism for settlement will follow closely the approach set out in 
      the ISDA '99 Credit Derivatives Definitions: once the Bankruptcy Event 
      has been objectively verified (i.e. using publicly available 
      information) and passed the 30 (60) day confirmation period, either the 
      protection buyer or seller can notify the other party that the 
      settlement terms have been satisfied. The fixed, pre-agreed payment will 
      then be made within 5 business days of such notification. The full 
      legally defined terms can be found in the Digital Bankruptcy Swap 
      General Terms &amp; Conditions.

<p>
      Very easy. Payment is triggered by the occurrence of a Credit Event, 
      which is defined in our documents &quot;General Terms and Conditions&quot;, as a 
      formal event of bankruptcy or other similar proceeding or analogous 
      event (see our documents for the precise definition for each). These 
      Bankruptcy Events are as objectively verifiable as possible, making it 
      easy to claim based on publicly available information.
