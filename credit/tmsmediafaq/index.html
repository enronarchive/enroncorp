      Based in London, England, Enron Credit allows businesses to evaluate, 
      monitor and mitigate credit exposure through a variety of tools. Enron 
      Credit is creating a more efficient credit market by helping to increase 
      liquidity through standardization and transparency.

      An evolutionary idea, Enron Credit was originally developed through 
      Enron Corp. to help its own commercial traders manage today's 
      accelerated pace of business transactions. Credit was a logical market 
      for Enron to grow into because of their unparalleled core competency in 
      risk management and recent success with the development of EnronOnline&#8482;, 
      a commodities platform that completed more than 550,000 transactions 
      with 1120 products in 13 currencies and surpassed $330 billion of 
      notional value in 2000. The need for real time credit prices has 
      accelerated because of the Internet. Enron Credit is now providing its 
      advanced, proven credit tools and bankruptcy swap products to traders 
      and companies at large. Enron Credit is perfectly poised to lead the way 
      to a more efficient credit market.

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Enron Credit understands the technology and financial concerns common in 
      the credit market. They are committed to the following principles: 
      credit has a price, credit exposures can be tracked in real time and 
      credit exposures can be quickly hedged.

      The Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) is a real-time &quot;price&quot; of credit for a 
      given company calculated using Enron Credit's proprietary model. Unlike 
      other qualitative credit ratings that are currently available, the ECC 
      is quantitative and market-driven. Enron Credit provides this free 
      measurement of credit risk for more than 10,000 companies on our 
      website. The Enron Cost of Credit is a sophisticated, real-time analysis 
      of dozens of credit risk indicators that help companies estimate their 
      expected loss on extending credit to a given counterparty.

      Whenever a company sells merchandise to another company without cash up 
      front, there is a certain probability that the customer will not pay.

      implications of the term, as well - companies are exposed in similar

      Enron Corp. has long been known as a leader in risk management. With the 
      development of EnronOnline, a commodity trading platform that surpassed 
      $330 billion of notional value in 2000, it became essential for Enron to 
      be able to manage credit risk in real-time. Created to address these 
      internal challenges, Enron Credit is now providing its advanced, proven 
      credit tools and bankruptcy swap products to the corporate market.

      Our strength is in the fact that we created Enron Credit to address the 
      needs we saw within Enron. That ere not being met effectively by the 
      current solutions in existence in the market. Enron is uniquely 
      positioned to understand corporate risk management needs and Enron's 
      leadership in risk management makes us well suited to bring such an 
      offering to the corporate market.

      Credit derivatives differ from insurance products in two important ways: 
       they are liquid, and they are quick to implement.  Liquidity is 
      important -- it means that a company can buy and sell coverage to suit 
      its current situation.  Speed to implement is also key in today's 
      environment, as many companies don't want to take the time to go through 
      the process review and documentation required to open an insurance 
      agreement.

      A DBS gives companies the ability to make their credit portfolios more 
      liquid giving them the ability to buy and sell coverage to suit their 
      current situation. If risk is concentrated in a particular company, 
      industry, or geographic region, a DBS allows a company to buy and sell 
      protection, mitigating risk.

      While a CDS has up to seven triggering events (some of which are lacking 
      in clarity),  the Digital Bankruptcy Swap has one: bankruptcy. DBS's are 
      best suited for the corporate market, because businesses eventually pay 
      their debts to primary suppliers. In addition, because it is a publicly 
      observable event, it is a very clear trigger.

      Enron will work with customers to tailor risk management solutions for 
      their needs.  While we find the Digital Bankruptcy Swap the best suited 
      to our market, we do also transact in other products such as Credit 
      Default Swaps, first-to-default baskets and first loss baskets.  In 
      fact, a limited number of Credit Default Swaps are even available on 
      EnronOnline.
